the world on drugs
ten yeah thousand dollar plates
thousand dollar plates
thousand dollar plates, fine china
shorty like a, uh
shorty like a
wheezy outta here
shorty like a thousand dollar plate, fine china
tell her that she beautiful every day, i remind her
then i jump in the pussy like a lake, i'm a diver
and her last man was a pussy, had a vagina
i get lost in her eyes, like dust from the skies
it's her body or nobody, i refuse to compromise
so if she leaves, i'ma kill her, oh, she'll die
did i say that out loud? i'm so crazy about mine
going insane, feel you picking up and moving things inside my brain
i know i don't have to argue about everything
but we don't have the same soul
went and sold drugs 'til we got a bigger bankroll
tell me that you love me, baby, say it again
repeat it over and over until it's in my brain
picked up the drugs so i let my brain go
woulda fried yours too, but i'm selfish about my percs, oh
i'm so crazy about mine wheezy outta here
i'm going to pluto with my girl oh, shorty
i'm going to jupiter with my girl don't call your exes
i'm going to mars with my girl don't call your exes
i'm going to saturn with my girl
been feeling like i'm running out of space
you need to send your location, i can't think
i done fell in love twice but i gotta be lying
'cause i'm living ten lives, i go crazy about mines ayy
did i say that out loud?
i'm so crazy about mine
when i look back
tracing fingertips over plastic bags
thinking, "i wish i could extrapolate some small intention
or maybe get your attention for a minute or two"
will i die? or will i get to that ten-year mark?
where i beat the extinction of telomeres?
and if i do, will you be there with me, father, sister, brother?
charlie, stop smoking
caroline, will you be with me?
will the baby be alright?
will i have one of mine?
can i handle it even if i do?
you said that i might
it's not fair or so they said
to carry a child
i guess i'll be fine
it wasn't my idea the cocktail of things that twist neurons inside
but without them, i'd die
they say there's irony in the music, it's a tragedy
i see nothing greek in it
give me a mausoleum in rhode island with dad, grandma, grandpa and dave
who hung himself real high
in the national park sky, it's a shame and i'm crying right now
to get to you, save you if i take my life
find your astral body, put it into my eyes
give you two seconds to cry
take you home, i, i'll give you a blanket
your spirit can sit and watch tv by my side
'cause, baby, i ran through a time when i felt you were doing it
i couldn't handle it, i was in monaco
i couldn't hear what they said on the telephone
i had to sing for the prince in two hours
sat in the shower
gave myself two seconds to cry
it's a shame that we die
when i was fifteen, naked, next-door neighbors did a drive-by
pulled me up by my waist, long hair to the beach side
i wanted to go out like you, swim with the fishes
that he caught on rhode island beaches
but, sometimes, it's just not your time
caroline
what kind of mother was she to say i'd end up in institutions?
all i wanted to do was kiss aaron greene and sit by the lake
twisting lime into the drinks that they made
have a babe at sixteen, the town i was born in and died
aaron ended up dead and not me
what the fuck's wrong in your head to send me away never to come back
exotic places and people to take the place of being your child?
i give myself two seconds to cry
let it crash over me like the waves in the sea
call me aphrodite
as they bow down to me
sunbather, moon chaser, queen of empathy
i give myself two seconds to breathe
and go back to being a serene queen
i just needed two seconds to be me
don't you dare say
that you'll braid my hair, babe
if you don't really care
you wanted me sadder
fishtail what's the matter, like that
skipping rope in the bayou, bayou
slip softly into rain
not that smart but i've got things to say
palm trees in black and white
i like to watch them say
you're so funny, i wish i could skinny-dip inside your mind
lately i've been thinkin' about how things used to be
swingin' in a nightgown underneath the old oak tree
almost victorian with you, you can talk to me
but lately, i can't see

livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
celery, tellin' me green is all i need
evidently all i seen was spam and raw sardines
this dick ain't free, i mean, baby
you really think we could make a baby named mercedes
without a mercedes benz and twenty-four inch rims
five percent tint, and air conditioning vents
hell fuckin' naw, this dick ain't free
i need forty acres and a mule
not a forty ounce and a pitbull
bullshit, matador, matador
had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious
kept me up watchin' pornos in poverty
apology? no
watch you politic with people less fortunate, like my self
every dog has it's day, now doggy style shall help
matter of fact, it need interest
matter of fact, it's nine inches

pension, more pension, you're pinchin', my consensus
been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
more divorce courts and portion
my check with less endorsement left me dormant
dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with

porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
choice is devastated, decapitated the horseman
oh america, you bad bitch, i picked cotton that made you rich
now my dick ain't free
i'ma get my uncle sam to fuck you up
you ain't no king
i like to see everything in neon
drink lime green, stay up 'til dawn
maybe the way that i'm living is killing me
i like to light up the stage with a song
do shit to keep me turned on
but one day i woke up like
"maybe i'll do it differently"
so i moved to california but it's just a state of mind
it turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie
wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
it's killing me slowly
dream a little dream of me
make me into something sweet
turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
fuck it, i love you
i really do
i used to shoot up my veins in neon
and shit's even brighter, you're gone
so many things i would say to you
i want you
you moved to california, but it's just a state of mind
and you know everyone adores you
you can't feel it and you're tired
baby wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
but it's killing me slowly
turn this into something sweet
it turns out california's more than just a state of mind
i met you on the boulevard, wind through my hair, you blew my mind
and if i wasn't so fucked up, i think i'd fuck you all the time
i really do it's killing me slowly
fuck it, i love you i moved to california, but it's just a state of mind
fuck it, i love you it turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie
fuck it, i love you wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
fuck it, i love you california dreamin', got my money on my mind
fuck it, i love you chances in my veins, running out of time
i really do chances in my veins, running out of time
life is awesome, i confess
what i do, i do best
you got nothing, i got tested
and i'm best, yes
lay me down tonight
in my linen and curls
riviera girls
i fucked my way up to the top
this is my show
go, baby, go
go! go! go! go! go!
i'm a dragon, you're a whore
don't even know what you're good for
mimicking me is a fucking bore
to me, but babe
in my diamonds and pearls
tell me something nice
about your favorite girl
need you, baby, like i breathe you, baby
need you, baby, more, more, more, more
fuckin' need you, baby, more, more, more, more
in my linen and pearls
i'm your favorite girl
i need you, baby, more, more, more, more
need you, baby, like i breathe you, baby, ah, ah
ahh, ahh
high, there's a reason for my high
there's a whole world outside
i saw it last night
yeah, they're saying i'm insane
'cause i wanna go to space
and leave it all behind
i'm leaving
i i, i've never, ever been this far away from home
and now i know
it gets dark, yeah, it gets dark
and i, i'm moving at the speed of light, i had to go
but now i know
it gets dark so i can see the stars
yeah, my feet came off the ground
gravity won't hold me down
no, not this time
i'm not who i used to be
'cause i came out here to see
the universe inside
i'm leaving them behind
i'm leaving them
i am sleepin' with your best friend
how do you like me now?
come on, get drunk you know you wanna
i am, you can won't tell no one about it
it's gonna be a ball it's gonna be a ball
i am lyin', usin' again come on
it's gonna be a ball
cigarettes, robitussin
will i ever get to heaven?
cigarettes, and robitussin
it's not looking good now, oh
it's not looking good now
come on get drunk, get drunk
get drunk, get drunk get drunk, get drunk
get drunk
finally, i'm crossing the threshold
from the ordinary world to the reveal of my heart
undoubtedly, that will for certain
take the dead out of the sea and the darkness from the arts
this is my commitment, my modern manifesto
i'm doing it for all of us who never got the chance
for, and for shut up, shut up
and all my birds of paradise shut up, shut up
who never got to fly at night shut up, shut up
'cause they were caught up in the dance
sometimes it feels like i've got a war in my mind
i wanna get off, but i keep riding the ride
i never really noticed that i had to decide
to play someone's game, or live my own life
and now i do
i wanna move
out of the black out of the black
into the blue into the blue
finally
gone is the burden of the crowley way of being
that comes from energies combined
like my part was i
was not discerning
and you, as we found out
were not in your right mind
there's no more chasing rainbows and hoping for an end to them
their arches are illusions, solid at first glance
but then you try to touch them touch, touch
there's nothing to hold on to hold, hold
the colors used to lure you in shut up, shut up
and put you in a trance ah, ah, ah, yeah
you got a face like the madonna
crying tears of gold
been pumping gas
at the texaco road to road
you're on the run
oh baby yeah you're on the run
oh baby
i'm not a trick boy, i'm a trick for you
you give me butterflies
heart skipping one two
i know you're sick boy,
i wanna get the flu
i'm running temperatures
thinking of your love, boo.
brooklyn move my soul like this
kissing my stilettos move
your mouth up to my lips
come on over ghetto baby
he said show me what you got girl
drop it like it's hot girl
i know your lips say
that you wanna but your heart's a no
but boy your hips say that your gonna when you hold me
hold me
you're so fun
baby you are so much fun
baby
my local rock star, the really big crew
i'm feeling you boy, you're liking me too
i'm clocking chicks left and right
just to get to you
you're out there on the grind now come home to your
queen, boo.
kissing my stilettos
move your mouth up to my lips
we're a match mad in heaven
if they're gonna talk let 'em
if they don't think we're good together
baby just forget 'em
when he's bad he's bad
but when he's good no one's better
cos we're a match made in heaven
and this kind of love's forever
you know it's crazy, 'cause nights like this
would start out with a little private party
you sneak me in your mom's house
i know i mighta spilled my drink, but
really wasn't tryin' to spill my heart out
i mean it started as a conversation
i was really tryin' to get my thoughts out
but then we make moves and we make plans
had the whole thing mapped out
see, you were gonna go to college
and to pay for bills i'd figure the job out
and you knew i had to say it, but them day's gone
now i moved on and you switched phones
hopefully reincarnation will bring us back to the place we belong
summer after high school when we first met
we make out in your mustang to radiohead
and on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos
used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
talk about our future like we had a clue
never planned that one day, i'd be losing you
in another life
i would be your girl
we keep all our promises
be us against the world
i would make you stay
so i don't have to say
you were the one that got away
the one that got away
i was june and you were my johnny cash
never one without the other we made a pact
sometimes when i miss you
i put those records on
someone said you had your tattoo removed
saw you downtown singing the blues
its time to face the music
i'm no longer your muse
the o-o-o-o-o-one
i'm falling for you like dominoes
from the top of the hundredth floor
look out below geronimo
tryin' to get behind the closed doors to your soul
why'd you have to end the show
we had such a beautiful plot
there was still more story to go
now look, i'm not insinuating that
you're some type of fair weather player
but even if the whole world falls over
i wouldn't be aware of a glacier
i just wanna see you wake up
doing your hair in the mirror with your makeup
then, maybe in the next lifetime we could make up
sometimes i wake up in the morning
to red, blue, and yellow skies
it's so crazy i could drink it like tequila sunrise
put on that hotel california
dance around like i'm insane
i feel free when i see no one
and nobody knows my name
god knows i live
god knows i died
god knows i begged
begged, borrowed and cried
god knows i loved
god know i lied
god knows i lost
god gave me life
and god knows i tried
god knows i tried
to red, blue and yellow lights
on monday they destroyed me
but by friday i'm revived
wear my blinders in the rain
i've got nothing much to live for
ever since i found my fame
god knows i lied
so let there be light
let there be light
light up my life
in the land of gods and monsters
i was an angel living in the garden of evil
screwed up, scared, doing anything that i needed
shining like a fiery beacon
you got that medicine i need
fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly
put your hands on my waist, do it softly
me and god, we don't get along
so now i sing
no one's gonna take my soul away
i'm living like jim morrison
headed towards a fucked up holiday
motel sprees, sprees and i'm singing
"fuck yeah, give it to me"
"this is heaven, what i truly want"
it's innocence lost
innocence lost
i was an angel looking to get fucked hard
like a groupie incognito, posing as a real singer
life imitates art
dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart, please
i don't really wanna know what's good for me
god's dead, i said, "baby, that's alright with me"
when you talk, it's like a movie
and you're making me crazy
'cause life imitates art
if i get a little prettier, can i be your baby?
you tell me, "life isn't that hard"
doomed from the start
we met with a goodbye kiss
i broke my wrist
it all kicked off i had no choice
you said that you didn't mind
'cause love's hard to find
la-la-la-la
maybe the days we had are gone
living in silence for too long
open your eyes and what do you see
no more laughs
no more photographs
turning slowly
looking back, see
no words can save this
you're broken and i'm pissed
run along like i'm supposed to
be the man i ought to
rock and roll sent us insane
i hope someday that we will meet again
running wild
giving it everyone
now that's all done
cause we burnt out, that's what you do
when you have everything
it can't be true
open you're eyes and what do you see
the last stand
let go of my hand
i hope someday that we could meet again
you go your way
and i'll go my way
no words can save us
this lifestyle made us
you're in the bar, playing guitar
i'm trying not to let the crowd next to me
it's so hard sometimes with a star
when you have to share him with everybody
you're in the club, living it up
i'm trying not to let the crowd notice me
it's so sweet, swingin' to the beat
when i know that you're doing it all for me
and every time you look up
i know what you're thinking of
you want my
groupie love
time after time, writing my lines
having my baby there next to me
it's so sweet, pouring you a drink
and pretending that nothing means anything
this is my life, you by my side
key lime and perfume and festivals
taking our dreams, turning them to things
it's like magic, babe, isn't life wonderful?
and every time we hook up
front row, every show like a hype man hmm
sing along word for word while she my bae yeah
side stage, fans screamin' causin' migraines
yamborghini-high, but she ain't on my grade hmm, hmm
god dang, got a nigga acting irate hmm, hmm
my babe, my babe, stay on my brain yeah
my babe, made me sing to a fire escape
city girl, but she grew up in the tri-state
she ain't got no time for no groupie love hmm
we don't pay no minds to the thug with a hmm
love girls, you and i, so who do we trust?
you and i 'til the day we die
you are my babe
big girl in the red dress
she's just trying to impress us
and she's got the barley fever
but she doesn't make a sound
she's just hanging around
down the court road early
with the hustlers big and burly
there's a million of 'em selling
and the buyers can be found
they're just hanging around
christ he told his mother
christ he told her not to bother
cos he's alright in the city
cos he's high above the ground
he's just hanging around hanging around
one of 'em comes over
got a monkey on his shoulder
and the monkey's getting grinner
but his eyes are on the ground
he's just hanging around
i'm moving to a coleheme
with the leather all around me
and the sweat is getting steamy
but their eyes are on the ground
shine on me sunshine
walk with me world, it's a skippidy doo da day
i'm the happiest girl in the whole u.s.a.
good morning, mornin', hello sunshine
wake up, sleepy head
why'd you move that bojangle clock
so far away from the bed?
just one more minute that's why we moved it
one more hug or two

"i love you, have a beautiful day!"
and kiss the happiest girl in the whole u.s.a.

and thank you for letting life turn out the way
that i always thought it could be
there once was a time, that i could not imagine
how it would feel to say
now shine on me sunshine
do you want me or do you not?
i heard one thing, now i'm hearing another
dropped a pin to my parking spot
the bar was hot, it's 2 am, it feels like summer
happiness is a butterfly
try to catch it like every night
it escapes from my hands into moonlight
every day is a lullaby
i hum it on the phone like every night
and sing it for my babies on the tour life
ah ah
if he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
that could happen to a girl who's already hurt?
i'm already hurt
if he's as bad as they say, then i guess i'm cursed
looking into his eyes, i think he's already hurt
he's already hurt
i said, "don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat
ooh
i just wanna dance with you
hollywood and vine, black rabbit in the alley
i just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
baby, i just wanna dance dance

ladies and gentlemen, the president of the united states!

i can now retire from politics after having had the birthday sang to me
in such a sweet way
i can't wait no more, no
let's have a baby
what are we livin' for? tell me
let's make love, let's make love
so long have i gazed into your eyes
wonderin' what they'd look like on a newborn child
i cannot lie when my hand is on your thighs
i'm thinking, isn't it a miracle that life comes from inside?
so long i have listened to your voice
wonderin' what it would sound like coming from a girl or a boy
isn't it funny that when you're truly in love
how just the thought of such things can bring you so much joy?
and i can't wait no more, oh no
oh girl, come and shut the door, go on, shut it
let's make love
you want to make love?
i'm leaving it up to you
i'll do what you want to do
but you got to understand
you're my woman and i'm your man
i can't even go for a ride
believe me, honey, i've tried
without thinking about a little baby
a baby sittin' right by my side
and if anybody in the whole wide world
ever thought that they could do that for me
they are one mistaken girl
'cause baby, you got me, you got me open, yes you do
and we're doing just fine
if you really love me, baby
if you can find the time
i can't wait no more
don't you want to?
what are we livin' for? tell me, tell me
come on, come on and shut the door, girl
you know what i want to do
let's, let's make love
you can whistle for it
baby, you'll never grow old in my eyes
with your golden grill, true love never dies
you wanna watch me while i watch tv
while you're t-t-t-t-touching me
we're forever young in paradise
as long as you got the chevrolet, i will ride
we're gonna party like it's 1949
we're in that chevrolet from july to july
gonna see it all before he says goodbye
every man deserves to see the sunrise
every man gets his wish
every man gets his wish you told me this
where is mine?
you said i'd never make it
out outta here alive
at the rate i was going, i'd be lucky to die
i was born so bad, not naturally right
the brightest star on hollywood and vine
we're gonna party like we're
running outta time
we're getting drunk and driving
fast on cherry wine
never do belong to anyone i find
leaving everything i ever knew behind
every man gets his wish promised me this
well, you lied
i learned how to make love from the movies
he found me waitressing at ruby tuesday's
he said i wanna buy you
a classic white milkshake
i said i'll serve you up
a special side of heartbreak
special side of heartbreak
i was working down in the corner cafe
you drove by in a chevrolet
whistle at me as my hips go sway
lana del rey, how you get that way?
how you get that way?
i said "he loves my heart shaped sunglasses
he loves the heart shape my ass is
cristal, crystal champagne glasses"
she eyes me like a pisces when i am weak
i've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
i've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
i wish i could eat your cancer when you turn black
hey
wait
i got a new complaint
forever in debt to your priceless advice
your advice
meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath
broken hymen of your highness, i'm left black
throw down your umbilical noose so i can climb right back
ah, tell me what the, ah, ah, ah
oh, you got me sounding good too, ay will will
okay, tell me what the deal is, you know i'm the illest
she from california, said she don't know where the 'ville is
shout out to the hometown, i know that they gon' feel this
when i hit the club, i walk in with a small village, and
nothing's off limits
when you got the sauce, you know they running off with it
now she actin' freaky, she was coming off timid at first
but i guess it really wasn't authentic, yes, sir
now she got me, ooh, doin' somersaults in it
know these fellas always talking but they weren't involved with it
i like me some women, not a bunch of sausages
i put in the work, i know that some of y'all didn't, yes, sir
and they come in all sizes, uh
we got new horizons
i guess i might as well dive in
no, it's not surprisin' the way you switched up
i used to kick it with the kids that rocked that osiris
used to rock a patch like a pirate
the garden still private
drama got a bentley, let me drive it
i'm a heavy hitter, darryl isaacs
and we rocking from side to side
tell me now if you're trying to ride with me
you know i can find some time just to get
in tune with you, ay, ay, ay
used to be the one that i idolized
now i can't see you the same as i used to
i guess i need me a ride or die
know you get sick of the games 'cause i do too
late nights, head hurtin'
open up the red curtains
you don't love me, you just networkin'
i'm still trying to be the best version of me
i got a whip plus room in the front seat
and it's so up-scene
she make me look like 2010 kris humphries
y'all been getting too comfy
i been spending my time going off
just in case you're wondering, never just one dream
eighty proof all up in my bloodstream
used to talk shit, now i wonder what they must think
blame it on the crushed dreams that we used to all have
all i know is that we can't fall back now
do too, uh
do too, do too
i know you get, sicker, games, too
know you get, know you get, know you get
i don't know just where i'm going
but i'm gonna try for the kingdom, if i can
'cause it makes me feel like i'm a man
when i put a spike into my vein
and i'll tell ya, things aren't quite the same
when i'm rushing on my run
and i feel just like jesus' son
and i guess that i just don't know
i have made the big decision
i'm gonna try to nullify my life
'cause when the blood begins to flow
when it shoots up the dropper's neck
when i'm closing in on death
and you can't help me, not you guys
or all you sweet girls with all your sweet talk
you can all go take a walk
and i guess i just don't know
i wish that i was born a thousand years ago
i wish that i'd sail the darkened seas
on a great big clipper ship
going from this land here to that
on a sailor's suit and cap
away from the big city
where a man cannot be free
of all of the evils of this town
and of himself, and those around
oh, and i guess that i just don't know
heroin, be the death of me
heroin, it's my wife and it's my life
because a mainline to my vein
leads to a center in my head
and then i'm better off than dead
because when the smack begins to flow
i really don't care anymore
about all the jim-jim's in this town
and all the politicians makin' crazy sounds
and everybody puttin' everybody else down
and all the dead bodies piled up in mounds
'cause when the smack begins to flow
then i really don't care anymore
ah, when the heroin is in my blood
and that blood is in my head
then thank god that i'm good as dead
then thank your god that i'm not aware
and thank god that i just don't care
guess i got what i deserved
kept you waiting there too long, my love
all that time, without a word
did you really think that i'd forget
and regret
the special love i have for you
my baby blue
all those days became so long
did you really think i'd do you wrong?
dixie, when i let you go
thought you'd realize i would know
i would show
what can i do? what can i say?
except i want you by my side
how can i show you? show me the way
don't you know the times i've tried?
guess that's all i have to say
except the feeling just grows stronger everyday
just one thing before i go
take good care, baby, let me know
let it grow
the special love you have for me
my dixie dear
boy, look at you looking at me
i know you know how i feel
lovin' you is hard, bein' here's harder
you take the wheel
i don't wanna do this anymore
it's so surreal, i can't survive
if this is all that's real
all i wanna do is get high by the beach
get high by the beach, get high
all i wanna do is get by by the beach
get by, baby, baby, bye bye
the truth is i never bought into your bullshit
when you would pay tribute to me
'cause i know that
all i wanted to do was get high by the beach
get high baby, baby, bye bye
boy, look at you lookin' at me
i know you don't understand
you could be a bad motherfucker
but that don't make you a man
now you're just another one of my problems
because you got out of hand
we won't survive
we're sinkin' into the sand
lights, camera, acción
i'll do it on my own
don't need your money, money
to get me what i want
they never saw us coming
til they hit the floor
they just kept beggin for
more, more
na na na na na na na
all dressed up for a hit and run
i was brought up as a southern belle
i grew into the queen of hell
you were just a little stowaway
that stabbed her way to save herself
you always liked the taste of blood
and i get off when i point the gun
it's so good to have someone to be so bad with
first one up was a preachers son
last one down was an englishman
i'm in bed with his bow tie on
sunday in notting hill
he was sneaking a cigarette
his god protects him but
i know we'll get him yet
ran my fingers threw his hair
so he thinks it's fun and games
he don't know our faces but
he'll never forget our names
i was waiting in the getaway car
you were stuck in the hotel bar
he was a proper englishman
you had one last pint before the cops broke in
you poured the gasoline and
i drove into the flames
history will hate us
but they'll never forget our names
if i need you now i can let you go
bwemba nkwagala kati i won't let you go
a-a-a-a-andre ndre on the beat
where i come from
okyusa my programme
sijja zanya drama
nze nkiraba twesaana
everyday ofuuse my body controller
be my soldier
yadde wayita mu bingi nolwala omutima
nkusuubiza sijja kulwaza
simanyi kwebuzabuza
kimanye nkwagala
simanyi kwekunyakunya
manyi okwagala
if you no go hit and run
nja kubaawo every time
if you no go break my heart
i'll be by your side
you mi number one thing i think of
yeah.
you me number one thing i sing about
ye nsonga lwaki i'm pleading
pleading for your love every day
boy i'm pleading, eh
nkusaba love yo
simanyi kwebuzabuza hey
out of focus
didn't take a second to notice
now we're separated by oceans, vast
couldn't make this last
i wish i'd have stayed
'cause love can find a way to make your feet run heavy
make your heart run steady
then it breaks
so i'm praying that you're feeling the same
you know i spent some time in hollywood tryna find
something to get the thought of you and i off my mind
so tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from falling apart
do you ever feel like going back to the start?
all the streetlights
illuminate what home used to feel like
and when i get to thinking, can't sleep at night
no, i don't feel right
oh, and you know i would if i could
maybe i spend more time in hollywood than i should
if you can hear me, does it really have to end?
i feel you close, although you're eight hours ahead
if we can pick it up, then just tell me where and when
we'll go back to the start again
if we can pick it up, just tell me where and when
do now you ever feel like going back?
we both know that it's not fashionable to love me
but you don't go 'cause truly there's nobody for you but me
we could cruise to the blues
wilshire boulevard if we choose
or whatever you want to do
we make the rules
our honeymoon
say you want me too
dark blue
we both know the history of violence that surrounds you
but i'm not scared, there's nothing to lose now that i've found you
and we could cruise to the news
pico boulevard in your used
little bullet car if we choose
mr. born to lose
there are violets in your eyes
there are guns that blaze around you
there are roses in between my thighs
and a fire that surrounds you
it's no wonder every man in town
had neither fought nor found you
everything you do is elusive
to even your honey dew
dreaming away your life
john met me down on the boulevard
cried on his shoulder 'cause life is hard
the waves came in over my head
what you been up to, my baby?
haven't seen you 'round here lately
all of the guys tell me lies, but you don't
you just crack another beer
and pretend that you're still here
this is how to disappear
joe met me down at the training yard
cuts on his face 'cause he fought too hard
i know he's in over his head
but i love that man like nobody can
he moves mountains and pounds them to ground again
i watched the guys getting high as they fight
for the things that they hold dear
to forget the things they fear
now it's been years since i left new york
i've got a kid and two cats in the yard
the california sun and the movie stars
i watch the skies getting light as i write, as i
think about those years
as i whisper in your ear
i'm always going to be right here
no one's going anywhere
i used to think that i could not go on
and life was nothing but an awful song
but now i know the meaning of true love
i'm leaning on the everlasting arms
if i can see it, then i can do it
if i just believe it, there's nothing to it
i believe i can fly
i believe i can touch the sky
i think about it every night and day
spread my wings and fly away
i believe i can soar
i see me running through that open door
i believe i can fly woo
see i was on the verge of breaking down
sometimes silence can seem so loud
there are miracles in life i must achieve
but first i know it starts inside of me
if i can see it, then i can be it
spread wings and fly away
i believe i can fly woo!
hey, 'cause i believe in you
oh
if i can see it woo!, then i can do it i can do it
if i just believe it, there's nothing to it hey
i believe i can fly i can fly
if i just spread my wings i can fly
i can fly i can fly
i can fly i can fly, i can fly
woo i can fly
hm-mm... fly, fly, fly
everything you do, everything i like
on the radio, dancin' in the night
flowers in my hair, roses on the vine
you can be my guy, and i'm your baby, right?
my, my, apple of my eye
looking really hot while i make ya cherry pie
show me what you got, got a sparkle in your eye
you're so high
i'm yours and i'm free and i'm fun
i'm wild as can be, and i want
i want you boy, i want you boy
i'm cool and i'm calm
a dangerous army of one and i caught
caught you boy, i caught you boy
every way i move, every way you like
pulling on my dress, holdin' me too tight
i know we'll probably lose, only got tonight
but i love the way we kiss, love the way we fight

like the way the bling on your pinkie ring shine
you spin me really fast and you catch me in the sky
i'm so high
i wish i may, i wish i might
have my one true love tonight
will you be mine?
oh hi, lookin' kinda shy
cause the way you put your hands on me
well i, i can barely breathe
baby boy you make me sigh-igh-igh-igh
thunder in the air, trouble on my mind
hold me in the dark, kiss it all behind
baby don't be scared, come on honey, smile
everything is fine now, everything is fine
my, my, talkin' all night
laughin' really hard and it makes me wanna cry
i love our playing house, love our dressin'-up nights
drinks on ice
i want you, i want you
i caught you, i caught you
i caught you boy, i caught you boy
so here we are
like we were
to feed apart
in different worlds
no need to say
another word

'cause i'm not really over it

the sharp knife of a short life

and i'll be wearing white when i come into your kingdom
i'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
i've never known the lovin' of a man
but it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
there's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
who would have thought forever could be severed by
so put on your best, boys, and i'll wear my pearls
what i never did is done
a penny for my thoughts, oh no, i'll sell 'em for a dollar
they're worth so much more after i'm a goner
and maybe then you'll hear the words i've been singin'
funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'
the ballad of a dove
go with peace and love
gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em, oh
