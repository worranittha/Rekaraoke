just a lost boy in a small town
singing "love is forever and ever"
good on paper, picture perfect
cause i know i'm addicted to your drama
you see me i be
i gotta tell them to myself
i'm still learning to love
no, i can't sleep until i feel your touch
and all i can think
so beautiful you're leaving me
when it wasn't yours, yeah
i feel like i could die walking up to the room, oh yeah
but all i think about
now i'm seeing red, not thinking straight
i'm really gonna miss you picking fights
even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit
dandelion into the wind you go
are the nights we were tangled up in your bed
and i won't be your victim
what the fuck did i do
blurring all the lines, you intoxicate me
kick in the door waving the coco
i wanna feel you in my arms again
and your craigslist couch and the way your voice sounds
vroom vroom, i'll see you latеr, bye
and a neigh neigh there.
i can't describe
i wish i knew, i wish i knew you wanted me
at the body shop
i just wish i can be there with you
if you love me won't you
stick by my side even when the world is givin' in yeah
everyone silent
over you
it's the end of the month and the weekend
ringin' the bell
don't leave me stuck here in the streets no, no
like she's the only girl you've ever seen
too late now
fairytales are not the truth
cause i'm in a field of dandelions
no time to have you lurking
mesmerized
i don't mean no harm
i still remember
i gave a second chance to cupid
i just wanna see how beautiful you are
brighter than a
i know that i'll be fine
and you know
you're goin' all about it in the worst ways
wedding bells were just alarms
we would meet on the very first page
third of december
i guess sometimes you fall in love
keep it together,
that'll work, come over
play me the classics
i remember the day
spend how i like it
and we don't talk but he sings along like
feeling used
you're right, now i know what is love and what is life
ooh, you called me up again tonight
got a lot of love, well you better save it for me
beat you, cut down, sit and feel the sound of
straight to ya dome like whoa whoa whoa
it’s not fair, yeah, i know
got your chemical all in my veins
we went to bed in france, then we woke up in japan
i think i'm losing my mind
you want her, you need her
you're right, every freaking night, just you and i
you should go and love yourself
now you're all in the past
and a moo moo there.
the only thing that's harder than sleepin' alone
it hurts me every time i see you
i'll run my hands through your hair
i'm running out of time
you're more than a sunshine in my eyes
i'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
some just rather say goodbye, bye
off of one touch i could overdose
i like you, i do
just take my hand
one day i'll watch as you're leaving
i really really really really really really like you
she be poppin' it
you tell me i shouldn't stress out
you want the girl with the small waist
some things are bound to be
that love isn't real
and i could try to run, but it would be useless
you wanna run your fingers through mine
cause i already cried enough
they don't want to see us get too attached
i always dreamed of a solemn face
if i got right then you might like it
i'm just protecting my innocence
when skies are grey.
oh, make you try fo understand
oh, i might stop talking to people before i snap, snap, snap
seems you cannot be replaced
long distance, i need you
but i know i will one day, yeah
taste that pink venom
and you may not think
nobody else
when everything gets in the way
all i wanna do is get into your head
and baby i'll keep it
you took my heart off my sleeve a decoration
and you come to me on a summer breeze
yes papa
and every time you walk out, the less i love you
just one hit of you, i knew i'll never be the same i'll never be the...
and i didn't wanna write a song
we'll get away with everything
and if you don't know me well, well
baby don't you leave
i don't know how to make it stop
i cut you off
haven't i made it obvious i made it very obvious
and i'm sorry that i couldn't get to you
do you love the rain does it make you dance
in her dad's new car
you're not my lover, more like a brother
too great for our hearts
i 'aught to get my money back
when we're holding each other
than the summer of two thousand and two
why you always in a mood
i call you but you never even answer
do you miss me like i miss you
and make up the same day, same day
hopin' it would save me
how much i liked you
even when i mean the most to you
and she's all i wanna be
no papa.
but ooh, this time i'm telling you, i'm telling you
i'm never gonna let you close to me
should be in your arms but i'm begging at your feet
so i made my decision
got lost in your eyes
i'll be your platinum, i'll be your silver, i'll be your gold
they don't really know
’cause we got a lot of love
fast forward to eighteen
then wound up at your door
don't matter what time, what town, i can't get you gone
now all i think about
cause i'm 'bout to pull his girl like a hammy, hammy wow
dirt, dirt, dirt
if you love me won't you say something
cause i been tryna hit it all week, babe
and then someone screams out
but acting like grownups
you're here with me
i don’t mind it i’m ridin’
i'm waking up in my dream
i'll be the one if you want me to
girl, it's obvious, elephant in the room
yeah, so you can cut me up and kiss me harder
when i believed in forever
for the future and all
only love can hurt
so make sure i have no clues
then one day feels like you wake up
with some indie record that's much cooler than mine
about you
we just need to slow the motion
this'll leave an ugly scar
that's funny, i guess you've heard my songs
we just need a face to face
she'd turn the rain to a rainbow
go home, get ahead, lightspeed internet
i'll be your soldier,
but now i'm all fucked up out in la
i walked in the room,
and you love startin' it, now i'm in a mood
let's show them we are
you hold me harder till i forget
work, work, work
if you come over
and to you i just keep crawling
baby, i miss you and i swear i'm gonna change, trust me.
girl you know i got you
but how could i hate her
i hope that you see this true
but my dreads too thick and that's alright
but i wake up and everything's wrong
but now i'm in pieces, barely believing
then carry on, but i'm not hidin'
than to go ahead and start with someone new
did ya know that my dreams, they're all the same
until you give up heaven so we could be together
love, love, love
too many times, too many times
show me how you do how you do
you're right, my love, you're always right, my love, okay
say something...
and now it's goodbye, it's goodbye for us
and i guess you'll never know, no
cause you know i can't do it on my own
it start beating again, if you were dead, i won't get hurt
i'm better than that, i'm better than that
you're the coffee that i need in the morning
we're nothing more than friends
people hearing without listening
maybe one day you'll feel lonely
cause we're living in a world of fools
so i daydream of what i could be
someone who will share this feeling
watch it falling for me, i love the way that feels
growing up's a waste of time
the day you kissed my lips
you gave her your sweater
you're the one that i desire
never gave me time of day, my dear
i can feel you over here, i can feel you over here
better hit me, baby, one more time
what's your favorite song does it make you smile
and i'll never be her
i wish i knew, i wish i knew you wanted me i wish i knew
wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time
saying, "this is it, i've had enough," 'cause like
can't believe that i haven't figured out by now
wrote it down and read it out
i know you since we were like ten
i just want your company
it'll be okay
if we go down in flames
you keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
you spent some time away
and i thought, "wow, if i could take this in a shot right now
yeah, she put it down slowly
i'll never let you go again, like i did
why you actin' all sweet
if it was ever hard to move
so why you tryin' to fake your love on the regular
decided to follow my heart
cause it wasn't yours
we breathe in the air of this small town
i was into you, but i'm over it now
but you only call
yeah, we're driving down the freeway at night
i should have bit my tongue while we were still ahead
a couple of things i can't spell without 'u'
cause i want this to be something
you're the light in my deepest darkest hour
must have been a deadly kiss
when i did not know no pain
like it was easy
if i decide if you're invited i wish i knew you wanted me
go on raise a glass and say, ay
and i cried at the curb
i see you beggin' on your knees
i'm way too good at goodbyes
snapping three, four
but it's been so long since i last prayed
cupid is so dumb
i'ma tip myself, i'ma spend it on myself
don't you share your smile with anyone else but me
there's a time that i remember
when you could be blowin' up just like my cellular
here we go again
80 in the benz when that roof go back
and i... will swallow my pride
put em up till they shut em down, yeah
and i'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
this ain't hollywood, this is a small town
i say make you no leave me diko
wishin' these memories would fade
watch as she stands with
tonight i'm getting over you
who will share this feeling
you're still in love with me but your friends don't know
and my heart changed
but i want it to be out of the blue
lead her up the stairwell
you get under my skin
that i really do
we're just friends
yeah all alone i watch you watch her
where we sang
all i wanna be
when they all should let us be
you're my saviour when i fall
and when you come close i just tremble
so i hung my head and cried.
you said it looked better
no matter how far
pilot up in the sky
ooh, girl, i like you, i do i do
if i had it my way
i love it, i hate it, and i can't take it
i don't care what they say
wishing on dandelions all of the time
i'll tell you how i almost died
drink my troubles away, one more glass of champagne
you can blame my stupid...
had never felt so low when i was vulnerable
more than anyone's ever been
let's take a lil' dip, lil' lady
so stop tryna' get to me get to me
dancing on the hood
dirty, dirty boy
give me love, give me fendi, my balenciaga daddy
oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
there in my rear view mirror disappearing now
spend some time, but this time ain't even
i still can't believe that you're mine
now he got me on a leash 'cause he said no strings
she's got everything that i don't have
doin' somethin' unholy
as if it was really that easy for me to get over you
i'm taken back to two thousand and two
singing at the top of both our lungs
boy, i don't give a fuck
you love me now and i feel the same way
i'm not even half as pretty
i hate you i love you
us, trust...
songs with all our childhood friends
i know i'm not the one you really love
and the memories bring back, memories bring back you
when you say you love me, that make me crazy
and if i were you, i would never let me go
the only problem was with you and not them
as the ones who gave me my last name
angel, you're my angel, baby
but i can’t
then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud
light as a feather
in two months you replaced us
brand new nigga with the same old team
try to make it out but i don't know how
your smell sexy, it lingers on me
when you ask
and what we got, got no hold on me
in the thick of healing, yeah
and a quack quack here.
you really ain't going away without a fight
you say you're sorry
but it's so good, i've never known anybody like you
know i'm not perfect but i hope you see my worth
and now it's crossed out in red
i don't but, you still hit my phone up
best part
i'm only here passing time in her arms
cause i know peter pan was right
hello, darkness, my old friend
i will never, no never neglect you
i just wanna hate you
but every time you're there i'm begging you to stay
i don't know if it's fair but i thought,
starting to think that i've lost all feeling
just get ready for work, work, work
pierced through the heart but never killed
i say, "i hate you," we break up, you call me, "i love you."
i just wanna see
when you only wanna do me dirty
or were we wellprepared
at the body shop shop
and if our love was a story book
i can't see clearly when you're gone
you fell, i caught you
dropping on you
doing something unholy
but it's so good, i've never dreamed of nobody like you
i miss you in my front seat
slowly lurching toward your favorite city
don't speak before we say too much
this that pink venom
listen to my money talk
cheers to the wish you were here but you're not
all you do is let me down
so now i can't stop thinking about you
but i learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
i wanna touch your heart
i'll keep dancing till the morning with somebody new
are written on the subway walls
friends i said friends
and by then i'll just be someone
everybody agrees
he's sat back while she's droppin' it
but now, i'm left here feeling stupid
the last chapter would be about
in case you go and leave me in the dirt
i'm livin' the life that i said i wouldn't, i wanna go back
how much more do i gotta drink for the pain
so what can i do
i'm a fool
try and catch me now
and kiss me slowly
no way that you'll see me cry
so bad
for all the times that you made me feel small
cause every time you hurt me, the less that i cry
i see the way you smile
oh, did i say too much
i have this thing where i get older, but just never wiser
i'll beat you there
every time that i say i'm gonna walk away
haven't i made it obvious haven't i made it
i needed to hate you to love me, yeah
cause i'm all grown up and i'm black and blue
i won't ever let a shorty go and set me up
every time i call you up
i've told you one, two, three, four, five, six thousand times
when you're out of sight
just who i was born to be
where are you where are you
that i forget about the pain
and i can't change your mind
but i go right back and
so please don't let me go
i wish i could shelter the boy i knew
dropping all my money
you hate me now and i feel the same way
masked up and i’m still in celine
the city's cold and empty oh
they were worth it all along, yeah
i'm losing count
i say, "don't look back"
i wish i knew you wanted me
i turn it on and make it rowdy
now that you're back, i can't decide i wish i knew
and i used to say, "never say never..."
i gave my all and they all know it
reasons that i think are sure, yeah
save me, save me
no, i don't know how
we, ooh, getting back together, ohhh
cause i'm afraid that living couldn't get any better
someone who feels like a holiday
but you never wanna be each others'
you mistaken my love i brought for you for foundation
and it's me you need to show
already on my way
why you always wanna act like lovers
have been the greatest moments of my life
but try to play it cool
you got me in a tight grip yeah
if i get another chance to
you say you love me, i say you crazy
now my heart feel like an ember
i do, i do, i do
and every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
and i see forever in your eyes
set fire to my purpose
yeah, okay
hit pch, 180
and they tear apart me
and all i know is we're going home
oh, girl, i know you only like it fancy fancy
so i cut you off
you know how to just make me want
lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
makin' myself crazy
there an oink.
cause i'm not your princess, this ain't a fairy tale
and i play him all my sad, sad songs
midnights สฺ my afternoons
but i can’t, no i can’t, no i can’t
set fires to my forest
no spoilers please
no sleep, you keep them lullabies
you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me talk to me
love is torture makes me more sure
cause i could give you all you want
everyone i do right does me wrong
go find a girl who wants to listen
a fool for love, a fool for love
you call me all friendly
cause, boy, i don't give a fuck
i'll carry these torches for ya
sipping on your lips, hanging on by a thread, baby
yeah, we are all we need
will never let you go this time ooh
and now i'm all fucked up and my heart's changed
but i need a good girl, i need someone to ground me
she only made it two days, what a connection
now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
did you get your middle name from your grandma
i need to tell you something
answer the phone
i wanna know i wanna know
said i'm fine and said i moved on
but i watch your eyes, as she
and i hope that we keep falling
keep on coming back for more
that you are slowly killing me
and everything would stay the same
made me think i deserved it
you need to get done, done, done, done
won't you let my darling know
you would know that you are
and then you'll probably spend the night at
to get me through
watch how my wons and yens, and dollars be droppin' on you, you, you
i'm through, i'm done
we, ooh, getting back together
my love, he makes me feel like nobody else
why would you ever kiss me
comes out just when you need it to
i'm just protecting my soul
how much i love you.
i wish i knew oh, i wish i knew you wanted me
i'm talking slick back, kick back, gang sippin' forties
before we were steady
and i want you. do you want me do you want me too
but the timing's off
i'm just walking back to let you know back to let you know
come on, come on, come on, come on,
so, i pull up in that maybach candy
and i'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine
a façade you can never face
i don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
do you love it when you keep me guessin' me guessin'
i was mistaken
feeling all the highs, feeling all the pain
cause i can see the sun light up the sky
why don't we leave it at that
ask me what's my best side, i stand back and point at you
i said, ooh, i'm blinded by the lights
designer crimes or it wouldn’t be me
cause only love can hurt like this
when you're leaving then you leave me stressin' me stressin'
don't let me go
find the second star, i'm soaring
if i woke up without ya, i don't know what i would do
i tell myself i don't care that much
yeah we could stay alone, you and me, in this temptation
you wanna keep me wantin' you
how i'm thankful for the life we've made
cause it's only you, nobody new, i put you first
you think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
shooting doubles like it's nothing
to catch me now
fools, said i, "you do not know
mismatched fits, that was way before you know me
and even now, baby, i'm still not okay
want me to spell it out for you want me to spell it out for you
emotion unlocking
sang offkey in my chorus
i just miss you on my arm
i'ma leave my autograph
you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
whatcha gon' do now
only if you knew
again then you can blame my stupid heart
you know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
watch the sun rise
feel my heart's intention
a bit too far
stick out the tongue now, swallow really hard, uh
i wanna go, i wanna go, i wanna go, i wanna go
put a flame to every single word you ever said
but when i try to remember
oh you're the best part, oh
i try to make you stay, but your
you grabbin' me hard 'cause you know what you found
so many times before
i'll never be the same
put your arm 'round her shoulder
we are more than lovers
just to not be yours
so don't go look at me with that look in your eye
that face of an angel
since june twentysecond
did we both think that this
breaking us down
that's how you fucking spell "friends"
is where is the ring
love me, won't you
you say, "stop playing it safe, girl,
but now i know, i'm better sleeping on my own
but i'm here right now, right now
my mama don't like you and she likes everyone
i'm writing a song
and if one more person says, "you should get over it"
pull me from hell bring me back again
i should be livin' my life so i go to heaven and never come back
and why, why, why, why, why
cause you made your bed, sleep in it
is this a part of your story
they come with prices and vices, i end up in crisis
when you know down inside
i need somebody who can love me at my worst
i don't even care
i'd spend 10,000 hours and 10,000 more
i want you to be my husband
mummy don't know daddy's getting hot
only gonna push me away, that's it
when they see green, when they see green, that mean go
i tell myself
stupid boy making me so sad
i know your eyes in the morning sun
i'm still tryna learn it by heart
and i’m wildin’, stylin’ on them
open your mouth
scream and we shout
i came here to drop some money
i know you say you know me, know me well
but you won't see me break, call you up in three days
like you already know that i'm the love of your life
when the store says, "sign for it"
ten thousand people, maybe more
i'll fall in love with the little things
you have got me wrong
does he laugh the way i did
you must think that i'm a fool
and it went just like this
everybody hurts someday, ay ay
you wanna run it up, i wanna lock it down
yeah, everyone know what i mean, mean
walks by
was the best that we found
with an oink oink here.
i'ma spend this check, everything on me, yeah
thought when i grew up
yeah, i need something "you proof,"
it's just polyester, but you like her better
is it too late to pursue
you reach in your pocket
just breathe and live and let it die
your time is up, i'll tell you why
and get drunken off your tears
you planning to get on one knee
we were sleeping back to back
stupid girl
because a vision softly creeping
come on and show me how you do how you do
so skeptical of love say what you say, but i want it more
my stupid heart
i don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first
you took my heart and my keys and my vision
do i still wish that it was you
but still, i want it more, more, more
i need something "you proof," aw,
just starting to crawl
i like you, i do i do
they never do
cause i honestly believed in you
just sitting in a cloud, oh, wow
cause i care more about what other people say
dollar bills, dollar bills
rehearse and repeat it, 'cause i
and whispered in the sounds of silence."
some things don't work
that's that shit that's never getting bounced on ya
talkin' in my sleep at night
’cause we argue all the time
when you said you needed space. what
and then we make love
and every time you told me my opinion was wrong
it's this sunrise
like we are in the present
nobody wey know the paranoia oh
i like you
doubting myself again, can't find a light in the dark
i keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
you're the sunshine on my life
when you're drunk with your friends at a party
but i just got a feeling
i disguise as altruism like some kind of congressman
but i'm over you
and i can't see the end of this
it was over my head
i just need time
hey, hey, hey
and it went like this, say
let go on the wheel, it's the bullet lane
you're to blame
what you, ooh, uh, what'd you do
finally able to see
on a yacht baby we would sail
now we are on top of the world, 'cause that's just how we do do it
cause i put a smile on my face
i would not give in, i would not partake
when i had nothin' to say you couldn't take it
oh, the way he makes me feel
you're the tylenol i take when my head hurts
but i still can't forget if i wanted to
and you let it burn
when we wake up
i keep it a hundred, we one in a million, no billion
yeah, i've been mixing liquors trying to get you gone
you know i'm cool with that
it's okay, things happen for
and now the chapter is closed and done
and i've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime
you got off on the hurtin'
no one dared
or send you a bouquet, saying, "it's a mistake"
sometimes i feel like everybody is a sexy baby
that you know i'll never drop, yeah
with a baaa baaa here.
i'm feeling lonely lonely
but it don’t make sense
you're thinking about the aisle
no more crying
i could live through every memory again
toast to the ones that we lost on the way
in your hulk outerwear
hear my words that i might teach you
i know that i control my thoughts and i should stop reminiscing
happy endings
and i guess you'll never know
uh, can i bite your tongue like my bad habit
i think i left my conscience on your front door step
we're not lovers
i'm getting stronger
if it's 10,000 hours or the rest of my life
twerking, twerking, when i buy the things i like
and i finally able to breathe
we are never getting back together. like, ever"
three, don't be his friend
me in your sweater
nun gamgo pop pop an bwado cheok
but it's the sweetest pain
the way it was
i believe in you
you think i'm crying on my own, well i ain't
i don't know, i don't know, all i know
to have no one around
i see you tryna' get to me
you know everyone is talkin' on the scene
make you plead and cry as you give up all the lies
can't wake me up nothing can wake me up
and an oink oink there.
you only call me on the, you only call me on the
haven't i made it clear
so i make friends with my shadow
and it drives me insane
and touched the sound of silence
made a move, could've made a move
thought i could be single forever 'til i met you
i look for his arrows every day
oh, i might stop talking to people before i snap
i found you
did you hear my covert narcissism
we know this thing wasn't built to last
come on, come on, come on, come on, come on and hey,
i made a promise, i'll never run and hide
i mean who am i to hold your past against you
and you're the first to say you want the best thing
i feel you touch me in the pouring rain
i was lost within the darkness, but then i found her
let's go get it, oh, oh
and i never like to admit that i was wrong
in this, this stupid war
kinda mad that i didn't take a stab at it
i used to not take chances with god's name
you won't love me back, no,
ne honeul ppaeaseun daeum
i've never felt so happy
i want you, in my arms
and when you told me that you hated my friends
i could never get attached
do you think of me
but i keep on coming back to you back to you
when my depression works the graveyard shift
wish that i was young, what have i become
rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling
you don't know babe
you got me so addicted to the drama
i would never fall in love again, until i found her
when somebody say your name
some just tryin' to get by
i know nothing at all
or right after coffee
cause you got thatthat, yeah
you want someone you can show off
and i read those pages.
now i know
in this world, it's just us
and if we had babies they would have your eyes
people writing songs that voices never share
all the sudden, i'm hypnotized
now you're textin' all my friends asking questions
i'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
but it's all in my head
tonight i'm getting over you.
now you're not too good for me, my dear
i could leave it in the past but you're holding on to what you never had
turning up at my door
say it's not that hard
haven't i made it clear haven't i made it clear
oh, when i'm like this, you're the one i trust
i just made a hundred bands
but i know you need to get done, done, done, done
while you're bringing me back to life
but i guess that dream wasn't meant to be like
but i have seen this all before
she's the only thing you've ever seen
i’ve been going through this on my own
started giving up on the word forever
he's sat back while she's droppin' it she
i got my head out the sunroof
i had so many dreams
tell me a secret
i'll be there, whenever you want me
that i'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
told everyone i'm a bitch, so i became it
so tell me that it's time for me to go
can't believe i chose you
hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
but now i know a perfect way to let you go
don't go look at me with that look in your eye
dollar, dollars dropping on my ass tonight
so i know we got issues baby true, true, true,
only love, only love can hurt like this
i don't know how to act
wait a minute, wait a minute, we was just getting started
and all my friends they tell me they see
how to erase your body from out my brain
in the same old drugs everyone else takes
here an oink.
cause you're my iron man
it's me
as long as i'm with you
for the last time
why, why, why, why, why
when i was living in the blue
but when we lay in bed
thought you were too good for me, my dear
he always call me 'cause i never cause no drama
go stupid, go crazy, babe
and if it's right, i don't care
or right when i can't eat
lucky, lucky girl ooh
maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
cross hearts i'vе been the one to ride
when we're out of touch
wish she were dead, as she
you got me cornered and my hands are tied
and everything's over
it's 4 am
they'll say you could do anything
i should not be left to my own devices
some people like to live
when i felt all of the hatred
that split the night
walkin' on you
still feel, eighteen, but i'm burnt out
but i still want that
wanna give myself to you
i've been tryna call
flyin’ private side by side with da
here we are, all of the lights
all of the people i've ghosted stand there in the room
i'm somebody you use, but never own
oh, i wish i'd find a lover that could hold me hold me
staring game is fine and you take me to the back seat
i guess i should take it as a sign
nowhere to turn no way
you couldn’t get a dollar outta me
oh, let me hold you
aw, i need something "you proof"
getting drunk on the past we were livin' in
every now and then i get inside my head
it must be exhausting always rooting for the antihero
you know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
i'm somebody you call when you're alone
when you hold me
lucky, lucky girl
that i need someone to save me
usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast
just want you
did you check on me did you check on me
mmmmm, mmmmm
your heart's so big, but that ass is huge
all the pain that we've been through
hoping i'll find
without any closure
baby it’s about time that we go
it makes me feel so nice
we are never ever ever getting back together
i think that you are the one for me
i knew you'd come back around
i just gotta feelin' that we might be friends for a long, long time
but then i get so numb with all the laughter
you got a way of makin' me spend up all my cash
they'll say that i was clever
i can't turn my head off
i wake up screaming from dreaming
you came out the blue on a rainy night, no lie
you don't even know how very special you are
cause you see people, people, people, people
maybe you'll start slipping slowly
take my arms that i might reach you."
you made plans and i, i made problems
ain't nobody selling nothing "you proof"
girl i like you, i do i do
ja oneul bamiya nan dogeul pumeun kkot
don't want it now i'm with you
but i feel like i die 'til i feel your touch
play the victim and switch your position
now, i'm crying in my room
so i think i'll fly away
she's laughing up at us from hell!
you take up every corner of my mind
yahoo girl no dey for here
to shine with you, with you, with you
but i guess i must be doing something wrong
oh, baby, do you like me, too ooh, ooh
i wish you wouldn't play with me
something that you've never seen
i put you first and you adored it
eyes are red and i don't smoke banga
posting pictures of yourself on the internet
nobody touch me, i'm the righteous
i fell in love, now i feel nothin' at all
you only call me on the weekend
you got me in a tight grip
and your brokeass car and that shit you call art
my life right now and the place i am
you talk all that sweet talk, but i ain't comin' back
i tell myself i'm done with wicked games
as we're getting old
save your tears
it's like you'd do anythin' for my affection
maybe i should just focus on me instead
i'm the problem, it's me
the stars and the sun, but still, i'm not enough
i needed to lose you to love me
and it brings me back to you
don't speak, just use your touch
of everything we've been through
it's just all in my head
i can see it in your eyes
you know how to just make me want to
remember how that lasted for a day
nobody text me in a crisis
picket white fence, but we paint it black
tale as old as time
scared the moment will pass
but i need to tell you something
when i awoke, dear,
but it's too late now
please say to me please, just say to me
sore eyes
i turned my collar to the cold and damp
i know you're thinking i'm cold
walk pass by then say hi
you just walked out of one of my dreams
cause if you like the way you look that much
you're still in my heart still in my heart
caution tape around my heart
silence like a cancer grows
tellin' me how much you miss me
and i... am feeling so small
and if you think that i'm still holdin' on to somethin'
from nights we don't remember
a little longer
this is a big world, that was a small town
i wanna smash your fears
for you not to notice
it's way too soon, i know this isn't love
we both know it's a cruel world
and i don't care if i never land
you can turn me on with just a touch, baby
all this bread so yummy, yeah
you got me dancing in my bed, so let me show it
i hear them whisperin' 'bout the places that you've been
i got new rules, i count 'em
black paint and ammo, got bodies like rambo
and baby i be movin' on
i'm flawed by design and you loved to remind me
you know how to just make me want you, baby
no matter what i do
over all my best friends
i like you, i do, mmm, i do i do
out on the terrace
won't you
i'm the first to say that i'm not perfect
but every time you hurt me, the less that i cry
blue sky
sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
never gon' run away
why then, if she is so perfect
gravity's holdin' me back
drinking from plastic cups
i feel okay when i see you smile, smile
you don't care you never did
if i turned back time to a storyline where my
you're making me feel brand new
makes no sense
i've got a smile on my face
beg you something please
sometimes, i don't know who i am
we were staying in paris if we go down
let's show them we are better
baby, take my hand
i've tried to let you go
and the sign said, "the words of the prophets
you could use me 'cause i still want that
say i wouldn't care if you walked away
it's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
turn a party upside down, just looking for something that does it
well, i guess that was true
look what you made us do
you make me happy
fuck you and your friends that i'll never see again
it’s a pain in my chest i just wanna see you again
on the day we fell in love
don't need you here anymore need you here anymore
spotlight is blind my eyes
i need something "you proof"
but i hit right back
she's all i wanna be so bad
try to leave your text unread
with a moo moo here.
how is it you never notice
have you got no shame you looking insane
and there you are on your knees
ooh, we called it off again last night
the days drag on
counting the tattoos on your skin
do you really love me, baby
and baby you're my winner
ooh, and i wish you wouldn't wait for me but you always do
i think i left my consciousness in the 6th dimension
doin' somethin' unholy woo
keep me warm in your love then you softly leave
check, check, check
i needed to lose you to love me, yeah
sneaking in l.a. when the lights are low
now we're arguin' in my bedroom
we'd always go into it blindly
get that shit inside your head
you won't see how buried i am inside my grave
you got me stuck on the thought of you
now we're under the covers
he love the way i drip, turn that pool to the beach
oh, we're on the right side of rock bottom
and i coulda copped a birkin but i cop celine
they don't really know—
i wish i knew yeah, i wish i knew you wanted me oh
i've been on my own for long enough
fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
i wanna see you lose control."
i don't wanna, i don't wanna be brokenhearted
yeah i've been sippin', i've been buzzing
i would fall deeper watching you give life
with a quack quack here.
like you already know you're never saying goodbye
and tenement halls
you're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head i blame
something stronger than i'm used to
to love, love, yeah
harry, you're no good alone
reasons that i can't ignore, yeah
is you're here with me
like, ever
and a baaa baaa there.
celine, my shoes
cause i've been working hard to fade your memory
always had to put yourself above me
i never learn, i never learn
every time every time, every time every time
someone you don't have to change
we're on the ground, we're screaming
oh, now
oops, i got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
i don't think that we could work this out."
now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around
you can't be reasoned with, i'm done being polite
get out of my heart
you don't even have to do too much
they don't really know you
savage love, did somebody, did somebody break your heart
the family gathers 'round and reads it
your love stays with me day and night
georgia, pulled me in, i asked to...
didn't think you would hurt this bad
can you be my friend
you wanna keep me wantin' you me wantin' you, girl
but i just got the taste for it
when my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
but i'm not yours
straight to ya dome like ah ah ah
memories follow me left and right
what can i say
but my love, he doesn't love me, so i tell myself
you're the one that i can't deny
my money moves
lookin' like an angel, but your savage love
don't give that away to no one
and i let it burn
why are you sitting at home on the floor
thoughts i never said
ooh, girl, i like you, i do
you can be the pill to ease the pain
only love can hurt like this
all that i wanted from you was to give me something that i never had
fill you up, then run it back again run it back again
i should have known, i should have known
so don't stress don't stress, don't cry don't cry,
it's been a real hard night
and there’s no chance
maybe it's the way you play your game
oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
she thinks i left them in the will
late night, watching television
we belong to you and me
i don't need your love
you can watch me back it up, i'll be gone in the a.m. yeah
mom read me a tale where
i can fill those places in your heart no one else can
in the words that it was forming
can you be my lover up until the very end
i wanna be your friend, go shoppin' in the benz
i need someone to share this heart with me
and it don't change
one day i'll watch as you're leaving and life will lose all its meaning
you left your diary at my house
won't you let my darling know that
cause the drinks bring back all the memories
haven't i made it clear i swear i have!
when i start to feel, i unattach
but you know it's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
you could pick the time and the place
how deep is your love
i wish
and i'm saying goodbye
if our love was a fairy tale
praying to god that one day you'll be mine
sin city's cold and empty oh
watch the sun rise along the coast
why, why, why, why, why why
my stupid...
don't need you here anymore
with you, oh wow, oh wow
cause you see people, people, people
and those brown eyes, yes
you know it's not the same
how i tried, how i tried to be great for you
in my mind
i guess this is moving on
i put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
you had to fight to have the upper hand
practice makes perfect
i'm so in my head
all alone i watch you watch her
please recognize i'm trying baby
when i came for my
cameras point and shoot shoot
when you're looking at me
someone tell me how
i've been movin' on since we said goodbye
cause the distant sky's always better than
so for one last time, i guess peter pan
and you were bound to see
give me what the hell i want
and i'm finding myself in the rain
yeah, yeah, yeah
she'll wear a tight mini black dress
tryna put it out
she got married to a boy like you
you could be my destiny's child on the scene girl
but i keep on coming back to you
one, don't pick up the phone
and i've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
we hadn't seen each other in a month
so save it, get gone, shut up
just one hit of you, i knew i'll never ever, ever be the same
baby, i am not your dad, it's not all you want from me
back to you
give it all, oh
i don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
it's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
i type a text but then i never mind that shit
too late
spread out my wings, i'm a fly, fly high
please don't take my sunshine away
you want, you want, you want, you want,
but ain't shit new to a freak
i've been done
i needed to lose you to find me
i'm sorry that i couldn't get to you
you know it's not the same as it was
paint a picture for you and me
now, did you look for me
she'd take the world off my shoulders
breathe deep, bottle it up
hold on, wait a minute!
out of my mind, out of my mind
i can't describe what i'm feeling
just one hit of you, i knew i'll never be the same
said, "this is the last one"
even though you mean the most to me
but then again, kinda
i've been hoping
give my last hello, hope it's worth it
but maybe it’s for the best
if we were a couple years older
what kind of pills are you on"
when i see potential i just gotta see it through
so now i ask
cause if you think i was born yesterday
wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
cause it gets so hard to breathe
whenever you go out
i used to call my mom every sunday
i bite my tongue, it's a bad habit
and in the naked light i saw
i figured out all the clues
i bring the pain like
now i finally found my wings
as we're both getting old
i guess he got lost or flew away
what a sight for
i've never felt so alive and free
wish i were heather
i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
the thing that i feel is stronger than love believe me
don't let him in, don't let him in
everything look better with a view
baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
did ya know you're the one that got away
to love, yeah
just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
don't mess it up, talking that shit
thought when i grew up i would be the same
oh, holy father
i wanna crush it in my hands
no kiddin', no ceiling, that's limitless
cause if you think i care about you now
two, don't let him in
maybe it's the way you say my name
if life is a movie
how could i ever compete with that
how many last songs are left
yeah, yeah
haven't i made it clear i made it very clear
begging for forgiveness, begging for me
your savage love
baby, i know she creepin', i feel it in the air
you see me
you only call me on the, you only call me on the weekend
now i'm standing back from it, i finally see the pattern
i'm getting stronger, i'm getting stronger
and all the clubs you get in using my name
but when you're not there i just crumble
hopeless girl is seeking
i've been drinking more alcohol
why we got the same taste for the finer things
my life is not a game
i get a little od
said you could keep them
i'll hit you when i land, can you fit me in your plans
didn't think you could change this fast
and a moo moo here.
she be poppin' it she
and the people bowed and prayed
what are we fighting for
and start over
say something, i'm giving up on you
it's green where you water it
cause i can't reach out to call you
lift up my head, i'ma rise
for some of that
waiting for the light to take us in
bitch, i do the money dance
i remember that weekend
so i'm snapping one, two
i know you'll go and change your mind
baby, i hope that this ain't karma 'cause i get around
you'll miss me, don't beg me, babe
join me i deserved it
i ain't tryna tell you what to do
how many more shots until you're rolling
i've been pouring 90 to 100 feelin' like
i'm somebody you touch, but never hold
and find me again
did you even care when i was gone
i don't need your love, so you can try all you want
want me to spell it out for you
or if i should be leaving
well, boy, i don't give a fuck
friends
let me drop bands, put a jewel in ya teeth
so she knew her love wasn't far away
i want you to hold out the palm of your hand
the other night, dear,
a lucky, lucky girl
now, i don't wanna fight this
and the perfect smile
and a baaa baaa here.
my money rules
maybe i was naïve
you must think that i'm stupid
i'm blasting our favorite tunes
you're my angel, angel baby
i'm here right now, right now
and the vision that was planted in my brain
neath the halo of a streetlamp
mm, daddy, daddy, if you want it, drop the addy yeah, yeah
and a neigh neigh here.
you know the door to my very soul
i dreamed i held you in my arms.
or were we too afraid
keep on falling for me, i love the way it feels
surrounded by couples all the time
you could use me 'cause i still want that your savage love
days feel like a blur now
what other people say
in the end
i know you're thinking i'm heartless
but hey now hey now, you know, girl know girl,
yeah, i always had to be right
now, i don't wanna fight this no
were we both too scared
you're like an angel
the mistakes that it bears
i just wanna live in this moment forever
i guess sometimes you find the one
my heart's been on fire
well, i'm too busy for your business
with all her friends around
all i know
if you still want it
when love and trust are gone
i see you standing there
i got new, i got new, i...
her nice big house
on our own cuttin' class for the thrill of it
and i try to fall for her touch
and for you, girl, i swear i'll do the worst
and before you could ask
they say, "just snap your fingers"
i really mean to learn
and we're a part of it, don't act so confused
was i a fool to let you break down my walls
i've been hoping somebody loves you in the ways i couldn't
you know that i see it
you're my water when i'm stuck in the desert
cause you got tired of my scheming
here's your perfect
turns out people lie
fuck you and your mom and your sister and your job
who gave you eyes like that
baby, here we go again
to the neon god they made
when my best friend caught you creepin'
say you're sorry
i only got one thing in the back of my mind
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down
don't you worry
straight out of a hollywood movie
she'd kick you out if she ever, ever knew
i'm going through withdrawals
you never ain't not around, yeah
so, please be true, don't fuck around with me
lucky, lucky girl yeah, yeah
did we hope on a star
it's not you and i
you're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head i'm sayin'
of an old mustang
now my heart feel like december
you got those pretty eyes in your head, you know it
ah but it ain't doing jack
something romantic
but we are never ever ever ever getting back together
leave america, two kids follow her
let's fuck in the back of the mall, lose control
should have known there was nothing about us i could change
everytime i close my eyes
you know i dealt with you the nicest
as i paced back and forth all this time
of the days when we were young, uh
but i broke my word
oh no oh no
i'm gonna love you ooh
i hate that i want you
nothin' to say
i let go of everything
i've come to talk with you again
if we go down
i would charge in and rescue you
answers i won't get
ooh, and i wished you would hurt me harder than i hurt you
if you stay forever, let me hold your hand
tell me what are you dreaming
a hopeless romantic all my life
fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
and maybe we can play house for the weekend
you're to blame you're to blame
while i die
you did things to me that i just can't forget
you keep playing, not another day with you shorty
til we had nothing left
someone will love you, let me go
my only sunshine.
something in me says "whatever"
when you're movin' your body around and around
i'll tell you why
wonder what a nigga might do for that
you turn me on like a light switch
i just keep on coming back to you
i hope that you see this through
but i will take my chances
but i can't put nobody else above you
and every time, every time you go
one by one then two by two
you're the best kind of bad something
and in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
i need a lover to keep me sane
mummy don't know daddy's getting hot hot
i just hope that it gets to you
we were staying in paris
some people like that hurt
hopeless girl is seeking someone
cuz we got bodies on bodies
yeah we got a lot of love but it don’t make sense
is sleepin' with your ghost
oh oh, keep it on the low
i answer too fast
baby, you're my angel, angel baby
stuck in a real bad dream
left its seeds while i was sleeping
you always knew the way to wow me
i really wanna stop
sorry if i'm way less friendly
i'll give them all my money
now it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now
and you would hide away and find your peace of mind
too big to hang out
oh, it's too late
we play hard with our plastic guns
you, you the one that i argue with, i feel like i need a new girl to be bothered with,
just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
waiting around is a waste
i don't know if this makes sense, but you're my hallelujah
for you i got
now we're having dinner
then straight on to the morning
turn, turn, turn
still got sand in my sweaters
snapping one, two
for you i got love, love, love
you're the best part, oh
do me dirt, dirt, dirt
whoah, you stress me out, you kill me
a little longer, i'm getting stronger
you'll never know, dear,
won't you give yourself to me
do you miss the road that you grew up on
narrow streets of cobblestone
envisioned it, just how i pictured it
when i never felt so lost
all the sick and twisted nights that i've been waiting for ya
stars in the sky, we infinite
everything, i wanna know it all
hey, i've been thinkin' lately
i'm in a field of dandelions
nowhere to turn no
how long it takes
and all the time we spent
disturb the sound of silence
i want more
rest in peace, please light up a candle
love her, once again
on me, than it did you
i guess peter pan was right
so i'm never gonna get too close to you
when you kiss me, i know you don't give two fucks
she's got you
that i kinda wish i did
i know that you want little ole me
i'm always tired but never of you
don't know
i will always remember
someone said it drowns a memory
somehow i always end up feeling bad
someone who's out every week day
i care for you
if i pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
i'm the same kid but i'm grown now
it's you, babe
usually i would never, would never even care
baby but the only thing faded is me
no, it's never been better
i'm feeling like this might be my time
the place is wrong
i would be the same as the ones who gave me my last name
when you close your eyes
you don't give a damn about me
about you and me
well i've been throwing down the whiskey
we don't need no wings to fly
inside my grave
perfect don't mean that it's working
everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off
memories bring back, memories bring back you
how deep is your love,
but nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out
your kisses burn into my skin
you are my sunshine
and i might never get there but i'm gonna try
did you check on me
if i knew i'd be with you
you're right, only me and you, that would be nice
seems like we do it just for fun
we're under pressure,
where you go i'll follow
yeah, i need to tell you something
i need something "you proof,"
burning hot through my veins
now, did you notice me
you're still in my heart
but i'm still missing you
she's such an angel
holding on
and man, it feels so new to me
nothings gonna cut it that's the hard truth
now i'm getting colder
as it was
i saw the signs and i ignored it
still remains
and i was tryna be nice
and the moment that you wander far from me
i hate that i love you
and if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
suddenly, i'm a fiend and you're all i need
funny you come back to me, my dear
johny, johny,
left my soul in his vision
your daddy lives by himself
you look so proud standing there with a frown and a cigarette
lucky, lucky girl uh
doin' somethin' unholy unholy
we were only eleven
i know my friends they give me bad advice
only thing i need to know is if you wet enough
and your mom and your sister and your job
it's two in the morning, the rain is pouring
i feel like i could fly with the boy on the moon
and when you want it, baby, i know i got you covered
now that i'm famous, i got hoes all around me
don't really know you
with a neigh neigh here.
but look where i'm at, look where i'm at
cause sometimes i look in her eyes
can i call you baby
but the grass ain't always greener on the other side,
but i'd rather work on this with you
a couple kids, one girl and a sailor
i guess that's why i've never given up
but my words like silent raindrops fell
and he, he get me prada, get me miu miu like rihanna ah
diamonds shinin’ drive in silence
when i saw you dancing
ha ha ha!
don't want to,
one that i had never lived
even wrote down the date, that i fell for you
is loving as good as they say
toast to the ones here today
so deep until it's all we got
i swear i meant to mean the best when it ended
and i think you should be somethin'
but these days i don't even know myself, no
you got me jumping off the deep end
cause you know it's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
where are you
and when you need it, baby, just jump under the covers yeah
to an island where we'd say i do
would you mind if i tried to make a pass at it
it'd be so beautiful if that came true
here's to the ones that we got
i was spending my nights in the rain
within the sound of silence
haven't i made it obvious haven't i made it obvious
baby, i ain't playing by your rules
you blamed it all on the alcohol
money, i choose
if you say she's nothing to worry about
i just want you, i just want you
oh, no, no, i just keep on coming back to you back to you
like this a slow dance
man now we stepping out like, "whoa" oh god
you ever wonder what we could have been
was the distance between
i always thought i'd be with someone else
as it was, as it was
while i was sleeping
for the past five days
tell me he savors your glory
wait a minute!
i said, "i would never fall, unless it's you i fall into"
but i still can't seem to tell you why
and now all this time is passing by
dated a girl that i hate for the attention
i wish i knew wish i knew, i wish i knew you wanted me oh
but you're still mine
but how'd we get in this position
and it's lighting up the dark
cause i know you wanna ask
and that's where i find
haven't i made it obvious
cause i might snap
come on and show me how you do you do
i tell myself you don't mean a thing
yeah, these are questions in my head
it's the sweetest thing
and if we had babies they would look like you
always missing people that i shouldn't be missing
and nobody's coming to help
i believed all of your dreams are fruition
we play games of love to avoid the depression
going out of my mind
you must think that i'm new to this
met a boy in green, i thought it'd be me
so don't wake me up finally able to breathe, yeah, yeah, yeah
you're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
so every lonely night, i sing this song
is that now i'm alone
if we go down then we go down together
as long as you love me
my best was just fine
if you had a twin i would still choose you
a glimpse of us
i said, ooh, i'm drowning in the night
so honey hold my hand, you like making me wait for it
or did we both give up
wish i were
i'll be your hova
i never stop falling for you, you never stop play with my head, my heart
let me show you love, oh i don't pretend
show them we are
and me falling for it screaming that i'm right
and an oink oink here.
fifteen dozen roses
you're the one that i love
fucked around and got attached to you
and i... will stumble and fall
i know i'll be in your heart 'til the end
from the constant hell i'd put him through
cause every time i open up, it hurts
all the bullshit that you put me through
i wanna go out from the freaking loop right now
so stop tryna' get to me
maybe we would be closer
but more than friends
everybody hurts sometimes
you said you just needed space and so i gave it
seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
and i just hold my pillow tight
her holding your hand
stole the pussy, you ain't get sued for that sued
eat, sleep, and breathe it
this dancing was killing me softly
hi

oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
and it's too late for you and your white horse
set a course for brighter days
something that you've never been
i can never say it on the phone say it on the phone
people talking without speaking
i got these feelings but you never mind that shit
chased the high too far, too fast
you leave me breathless
in the middle of the woods
everywhere an oink oink.
you said you wouldn't and you fucking did
holdin' me back
i just found out, the only reason that you lovin' me

i got niggas tryna end me
you tore me down and now it's showing
baby, take a chance
and how you don't know how to keep your business clean

cool wind in my hair
it's a crazy thing
boy wanna what no boy outta my way
all of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
i'm in love with your body
warm smell of colitas
some people want diamond rings
dreaming about the things that we could be
don't underestimate the things that i will do
you look like my next mistake
and now i wonder
you're the one i love
every day discovering something brand new
another winter day
give me a sign
tell me what you want to do
so i
and every star in the sky is taking
and i know just how to lie

the road that was broken
and some were lost in the rocky
and i feel just like

less than one minute old
is how you annoy me daily
it never
we talk for
i was upside down
and i'm
such a lovely face
you've got your family and they need you there
baby i'm done
and i miss you
why you calling me up saying sorry again
and all along i believed i would find you
your love was handmade for somebody like me
and i always know the name of the game
why do you say the things that you say
of our own device
and watch space odyssey
you're the one i need
but we don't know how to come down
and you're spending all your time
oh it really lifts my heart
you came to the table
if i could just hold you tonight
it'll leave you breathless mm
that someday it would lead me back to you
come and rest your bones with me
when i say you're not the best i've ever had
that may be all i need
in my bedroom and my closet
can lift your heart
they say love hurts
i'm in love with the shape of you
and i know the night is fading
'cause we're young and we're reckless oh
that it's just not enough
do you think time would pass me by
you twist to fit the mold that i am in
don't tell me it's not worth trying for
promise i won't let you down
and you played it tears are gonna fall
and i wanna take you with me
talk to you and make you understand
such a lovely place such a lovely place
walking fast faces pass and i'm homebound
and everything you do
i will be brave
ooh baby
that's so us
every breath every hour has come to this
just because i'm on my
woe is me
i don't fall for boys like you i don't fall for
i'd like to make it with you
me and my friends at the table doing
and all my
but without you i'm incomplete
i never thought through love we'd be
and god tell us the reason
please don't tell
i really think that we could make it girl
walk in the
and i know the
you're the one that always calls
just the same
yeah we're both a lot to handle
got a long list of
hmm and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
inside these
i'm lucky we're in love in every way
lucky we're in love in every way
you pull me close
be that girl for a month
some just want everything
every time we say goodbye
grab on my waist and put that body on me
in darkness she is all i see you are all i see
you get what you give and give what you get so
you can do it babe
and what good would it be
falling in love
don't care what you do you
repeat after me now
sometimes i wonder how we ever came to be
lucky i'm in love with my best friend
and meet me there tonight
well he took it to the city
think i know it's with me
we're falling in love
out of nothing at all
you can tell me when it's over mm
can't you see the glow on the window pane
true love true love
from where you are
still feel all alone
'cause we're young and we're reckless
we'll have one on each knee
it must be true love
streaming through the
inside the pocket of your
and some would curse john
since she brought you down
and say it's all right say it's all right
i'm fine baby how are you
but shit that wouldn't solve them
take a look into that mirror if you wonder why you lost me
we're falling like the stars
love's a game wanna play ay
if the high was worth the pain
you can't tell me it's not worth trying for
and i know just what to prove
but i don't want nothing at all
under the open sky oh my baby i'm trying
if you could see that i'm the one
isn't she lovely
you've got a soul and everybody knows
as we dance the night away
is not the
look at the stars
so then i took my turn
i can make tonight forever
in this institution

we don't know how to come down
saying i love you
the meaning of her name

the next the next the next

and the feeling of the wind in your face
next to your heartbeat where i should be

found a piece of shining gold
making love out of nothing at all
they stab it with their steely
they don't know how long it

a few stolen moments is all that we share
but fuck i'm still so empty
i saw a shimmering light
what's going on
and i've been keeping all the
heart beats fast

and i know just why you could not
four kids and no sleep
'cause you're crying like a baby but do i look like your mommy

the club isn't the best place to find a lover
this beautiful lady
isn't she pretty
boy i'm so happy
love gives you the right to be free
remind me of us tears are gonna fall
to the place i was before
if my heart was torn in two
and you still let me win
that the physical things
oh i would fight for you yeah i'd lie for you
all i know is pouring rain
down this river every turn
not to say but if you only knew
they keep me thinking rolling in the deep
can't do crowds not our scene
just once try to wrap your little brain around my feelings
god give us the reason
laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
and still those
is that you just don't realize how much i love you
get drunk on the good life i'll take you to
i try all the time
i see this life like a swinging vine
and so i wake in the morning and i step outside
relax
i'm the one who
when it gets hard you know it can get hard sometimes
if i took those
i know just how to fake it
with their hand froze to the
you know it's true you know it's true
got on board a westbound
and in my face is flashing
but watching you stand alone
we make peppermint tea
to an island where we'll meet
more than
there were
just a speck of dust within the galaxy
yeah fingers trace your every outline oh yeah yeah
but you always believed in me
yesterday i saw a lion kiss a deer
in this wrong situation
and i've got an aching head
i wanna wrap my hands around your neck
i feel your whisper across the sea
some people search for a fountain
driving slow on sunday morning driving slow
i feel something so right
gimme a break give me a break
and i sing in the car
old but i'm not that old
oh i'm in love falling like the stars
you won't ever be alone
and i try
sometimes i hate every single stupid word you say
where our eyes are never closing
wait the worst is yet to come oh no
make that money watch it burn
you won't ever be alone wait for me to come home
'cause there's nothing like seeing
you belong with me
if i could cleanse my soul
love can be right or wrong
and she
oh that talk of opportunities tv
baby you're the one that i love
you're the only thing i see
make a home down there as mine sure won't be
i've had my run
wake in the morning and step outside
i think it must be
and back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
take a deep breath and i get real high
they leave me breathless tears are gonna fall
when i'm sick when i'm sad
'cause you were all yellow
in every little thing only time will tell
and i'll never let you fall
get out of my
if i ain't got you you you
you can find it here
may be
if we're not careful
and a flower in your hair

when you wake up early in the
so tell everybody i'm on my way
if i ain't got you with me baby
yeah yeah
yeah someday oh someday oh

one red flag and i'm gone already onto
you know i love you so
oh i remember you driving to my house
i won't lie to you
staring blankly ahead
another sunny place
and i i don't wanna let you know
life and love are the same
so let's get drunk on our tears
in paris and rome
promises forever young
when you say that he's the one that you want
you're the king baby i'm your queen
left that stone in the river bed
and nothing but good times to share
in their lumbering conestogas
what are you hearing
we could be beautiful
fill up your
hey what you doing with a girl like that
and i wanna go home
in the back of my mind making me feel like
and if you're wondering what this song is leading to
sometimes i wanna slap you in your whole face whoa oh oh
it's not very easy living all alone
just to hear them say
you said be patient just wait a little longer
it is the only thing
up ahead in the distance
baby 'cause you're the one that i love

Do you hear me, I'm talking to you
Across the water across the deep blue ocean
Under the open sky, oh my, baby I'm trying

Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again

And so I'm sailing through the sea
To an island where we'll meet
You'll hear the music fill the air
I'll put a flower in your hair
Though the breezes through the trees
Move so pretty you're all I see
As the world keeps spinning round
You hold me right here right now
Lucky I'm in love with my best friend

My luck is changing it's gotten from simply roten
To something worst
Who knows someday i will win too
I'll begin to reach my pride
Now that i see what our end is
All can spend is just my time

Till that lucky day you know darn well, baby
I can't give you anything but love

All I knew
This morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen
Since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind making me feel like
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like comin' home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
And all my walls
Stood tall painted blue
But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel
In my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, makin' up for lost time
Takin' flight, makin' me feel like
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

And your eyes look like comin' home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
Come back and tell me why
I'm feelin' like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
All I know is we said, "Hello"
Your eyes look like comin' home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
All I know is we said, "Hello"
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
(Never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
(Rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
Of your hands (never had met me)
And you played it (tears are gonna fall)
To the beat (rolling in the deep)
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared
The scars of your love (never had met me)
Remind me of us (tears are gonna fall)
They keep me thinking (rolling in the deep)
That we almost had it all (you're gonna wish you)
The scars of your love (never had met me)
They leave me breathless (tears are gonna fall)
I can't help feeling (rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
(Never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
(Rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
Of your hands (never had met me)
And you played it (tears are gonna fall)
To the beat (rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating
Throw your soul through every open door (whoa)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (whoa)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (whoa)
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown
We could've had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
(Never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
(Rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
Of your hands (never had met me)
And you played it (tears are gonna fall)
To the beat (rolling in the deep)
Could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
(Never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
(Rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
Of your hands (never had met me)
But you played it, you played it, you played it
You played it to the beat
I swear to God, when I come home
I'm gonna hold you so close
I swear to God, when I come home
I'll never let go
Like a river, I flow
To the ocean I know
You pull me close
Guiding me home
And I need you to know that we're falling so fast
We're falling like the stars
Falling in love
And I'm not scared to say those words, with you, I'm safe
We're falling like the stars
We're falling in love
I swear to God, I can see
Four kids and no sleep
We'll have one on each knee
You and me, hmm
And when they've grown up
You're still the girl in the club
When I held your hair up
'Cause you had too much
And I need you to know that we're falling so fast
We're falling like the stars
Falling in love
And I'm not scared to say those words, with you, I'm safe
We're falling like the stars
Falling in love
I swear to God, every day
He won't take you away
'Cause without you, babe
I lose my way
Oh, I'm in love
Oh, I'm in love
Oh, I'm in love
Oh, I'm in love
Oh, I'm in love
Oh, I'm in love (falling like the stars)
And I need you to know that we're falling so fast
We're falling like the stars
Falling in love
And I'm not scared to say those words, with you, I'm safe
We're falling like the stars
We're falling in love
Why you calling me up saying "sorry" again?
Already told you we're done, what didn't you get?
Don't forget, you're the one that tried to get with my friends
The end, the end, the end, the end
Well, you must be going crazy thinking I'll be back, I'm sorry
'Cause you're crying like a baby, but do I look like your mommy?
Take a look into that mirror if you wonder why you lost me
Gotta sit down and shut up, you did it to yourself
Boy, gonna diss me? Boy, I'm so pissed
Boy, gonna miss me, boy, you are dismissed
'Cause I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
Boy, wanna date me? Boy, outta date, yeah
Boy, wanna- (what? No) boy, outta my way
'Cause I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
I see through sweet little lies and every excuse
When you start every fight, the blame is on you
One red flag and I'm gone, already onto
The next, the next, the next
Well, you must be going crazy thinking I'll be back, I'm sorry
'Cause you're crying like a baby, but do I look like your mommy?
Take a look into that mirror if you wonder why you lost me
Gotta sit down and shut up, you did it to yourself
Boy, gonna diss me? Boy, I'm so pissed
Boy, gonna miss me, boy, you are dismissed
'Cause I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
Boy, wanna date me? Boy, outta date, yeah
Boy, wanna- (what? No) boy, outta my way
'Cause I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
You can raise your voice, but know that you have no choice
Don't care what you do (you)
You can raise your voice, but know that you have no choice
Don't care what you do (you)
So turn around, walk away
You made your bed, so you gotta lay
Get out of my way!
Boy, gonna diss me? Boy, I'm so pissed
Boy, gonna miss me, boy, you are dismissed
'Cause I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
Boy, wanna date me? Boy, outta date, yeah
Boy, wanna- (what? No) boy, outta my way
'Cause I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
I don't fall for boys like you (I don't fall for)
You can raise your voice, but know that you have no choice
Don't care what you do (you)
You can raise your voice, but know that you have no choice
Don't care what you do (you), oh, you
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
I'm in love with your body
(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
I'm in love with your body
(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
I'm in love with your body
(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
I'm in love with your body
(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

In the Spring of forty-seven
So the story, it is told
Old John Sutter went to the mill side
Found a piece of shining gold.
Well, he took it to the city
Where the word, like wildfire, spread.
And old John Sutter soon came to wish he'd
Left that stone in the river bed.
For they came like herds of locusts
Every woman, child and man
In their lumbering Conestogas
They left their tracks upon the land...
Some would fail and some would prosper
Some would die and some would kill
Some would thank the Lord for their deliverance
And some would curse John Sutter's Mill.
Well, they came from New York City
And they came here at Alabam'
With their dreams of finding fortunes
In this wild unsettled land.
Well, some fell prey to hostile arrows
As they tried to cross the plains.
And some were lost in the Rocky Mountains
With their hand froze to the reins
Oh, some would fail and some would prosper
Some would die and some would kill
Some would thank the Lord for their deliverance
And some would curse John Sutter's Mill...
Some pushed on to California
Rather stopped to take their rest.
And by the Spring of Eighteen-sixty
They had opened up the west.
And then the railroad came behind them
And the land was plowed and tamed
When Old John Sutter went to meet his maker
He'd not one penny to his name.
Oh, some would fail and some would prosper
Some would die and some would kill
Some would thank the Lord for their deliverance
And some would curse John Sutter's Mill.
And some would curse John Sutter's Mill
Some men's thirsts are never filled.
Yeah
Sunday morning, rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy
Living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you
That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
Well I never want to leave
Yeah, fingers trace your every outline, oh yeah, yeah
Yeah, ain't a picture with my hands, ohh!
And back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather still together when it ends
That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
Yeah
Oh yeah
But things just get so crazy living
Life gets hard to do (life gets hard)
Sunday morning rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing someday it'll bring me back to you,
Yeah (Someday oh, someday oh)
Find a way to bring myself back home to you
You may not know
That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see (you are all I see)
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning, driving slow
Yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
And a flower in your hair
I'm a flower in your hair
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, woah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, woah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sometimes I hate every single stupid word you say
Sometimes I wanna slap you in your whole face (whoa oh oh)
There's no one quite like you, you push all my buttons down
I know life would suck without you (whoa oh oh)
At the same time, I wanna hug you
I wanna wrap my hands around your neck
You're an asshole but I love you
And you make me so mad, I ask myself
Why I'm still here, or where could I go
You're the only love I've ever known
But I hate you, I really hate you
So much I think it must be
True love, true love
It must be true love
Nothin' else can break my heart like
True love, true love
It must be true love
No one else can break my heart like you
Whoa oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just once try to wrap your little brain around my feelings
Just once please try no to be so mean (whoa oh oh)
Repeat after me now R-O-M-A-N-C-E-E-E
Come on I'll say it slowly (Romance!)
You can do it babe
At the same time, I wanna hug you
I wanna wrap my hands around your neck
You're an asshole but I love you
And you make me so mad, I ask myself
Why I'm still here, or where could I go
You're the only love I've ever known
But I hate you, I really hate you
So much I think it must be
True love, true love
It must be true love
Nothin' else can break my heart like
True love, true love
It must be true love
No one else can break my heart like you
Whoa oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Think it must be love (I love you)
I think it must be love (I love you)
Why do you rub me up the wrong way?
Why do you say the things that you say?
Sometimes I wonder how we ever came to be
But without you I'm incomplete
I think it must be
True love, it must be true love
It must be true love
Nothin' else can break my heart like
True love, true love
It must be true love
No one else can break my heart like you
Whoa oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
No one else can break my heart like you
Whoa oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
No one else can break my heart like you
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Hmm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
Hmm, we keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
"Wait for me to come home"
I know just how to whisper
And I know just how to cry
I know just where to find the answers
And I know just how to lie
I know just how to fake it
And I know just how to scheme
I know just when to face the truth
And then I know just when to dream
And I know just where to touch you
And I know just what to prove
I know when to pull you closer
And I know when to let you loose
And I know the night is fading
And I know the time's gonna fly
And I'm never gonna tell you everything I've gotta tell you
But I know I've gotta give it a try
And I know the roads to riches
And I know the ways to fame
I know all the rules and then I know how to break 'em
And I always know the name of the game
But I don't know how to leave you
And I'll never let you fall
And I don't know how you do it
Making love out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all
Making love out of nothing at all
Everytime I see you all the rays of the sun are
Streaming through the waves in your hair
And every star in the sky is taking aim at
Your eyes like a spotlight
The beating of my heart is a drum, and it's lost
And it's looking for a rhythm like you
You can take the darkness at the pit of the night
And turn into a beacon burning endlessly bright
I've gotta follow it 'cause everything I know
Well, it's nothing 'til I give it to you
I can make the runner stumble
I can make the final block
I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle
I can make all the stadiums rock
I can make tonight forever
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn
I can make you every promise that has ever been made
And I can make all your demons be gone
But I'm never gonna make it without you
Do you really want to see me crawl
And I'm never gonna make it like you do
Making love out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all
I've been thinkin' 'bout my father lately
The person that he made me
The person I've become
And I've been tryna fill all of this empty
But, fuck, I'm still so empty
And I could use some love
And I've been trying to find a reason to get up
Been trying to find a reason for this stuff
In my bedroom and my closet
The baggage in my heart is still so dark
Modern loneliness, we're never alone
But always depressed, yeah
Love my friends to death
But I never call and I never text, yeah
La di da di da
You get what you give and give what you get, so
Modern loneliness, we love to get high
But we don't know how to come down
If I could break my DNA to pieces
Get rid of all my demons
If I could cleanse my soul
Then I could fill the world with all my problems
But, shit, that wouldn't solve them
So, I'm left here alone
And I've been trying to find a reason to get up
Been trying to find a reason for this stuff
In my bedroom and my closet
The baggage in my heart is still so dark
Modern loneliness, we're never alone
But always depressed, yeah
Love my friends to death
But I never call and I never text, yeah
La di da di da
You get what you give and give what you get, so
Modern loneliness, we love to get high
But we don't know how to come down
Down, down, down, down, down
We don't know how to come down
Down, down, down, down, down
We don't know how to come down
Down, down, down, down, down
We don't know how to come down
Down, down, down, down, down
We don't know how to come down
Modern loneliness, we're never alone
But always depressed, yeah
Love my friends to death
But I never call and I never text, yeah
La di da di da
You get what you give and give what you get, so
Modern loneliness, we love to get high
But we don't know how to come down
Down, down, down, down, down
We don't know how to come down
Down, down, down, down, down
We don't know how to come down
Down, down, down, down, down
We don't know how to come down
Down, down, down, down, down
We don't know how to come down
Modern loneliness, we're never alone
But always depressed, yeah
I'm sorry but
Don't wanna talk, I need a moment 'fore I go
It's nothing personal
I draw the blinds
They don't need to see me cry
'Cause even if they understand
They don't understand
So then when I'm finished
I'm all 'bout my business and ready to save the world
I'm taking my misery
Make it my bitch, can't be everyone's favorite girl
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
Lo siento mucho (Farru), pero me voy
Porque a tu lado me di cuenta que nada soy
Y me cansé de luchar y de guerrear en vano
De estar en la línea de fuego y de meter la mano
Acepto mis errores, también soy humano
Y tú no ve' que lo hago porque te amo
Pero ya (Ya) no tengo más na' que hacer aquí (aquí)
Me voy, llegó la hora 'e partir (partir)
De mi propio camino, seguir lejos de ti
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise (is on the rise, na-na)
The fire burning in my eyes (the fire burning in my eyes)
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Everybody keep me safe
Everybody keep me safe
Everybody keep me safe
Everybody, everybody on my way
So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
"Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?" Ay
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young, and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh, my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young, and we're reckless (oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm (oh)
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (insane)
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (over)
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane)
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young, and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far (ooh)
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar (leave a nasty scar)
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
25 years and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
"What's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, uh huh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, uh huh
And I try
Oh my God, do I try
I try all the time
In this institution
And I pray
Oh my God, do I pray
I pray every single day
For revolution
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out, what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
"What's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
(Wake in the morning and step outside)
Hey-ey-ey
(Take a deep breath and I get real high)
(And I scream)
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
(Wake in the morning and step outside)
Hey-ey, yeah yeah yeah
(Take a deep breath and I get real high)
(And I scream)
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, uh huh
25 years and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination, mmm
Please, don't see
Just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
Please, see me
Reaching out for someone I can't see
Take my hand
Let's see where we wake up tomorrow
Best laid plans
Sometimes are just a one night stand
I'll be damned
Cupid's demanding back his arrow
So let's get drunk on our tears
And, God, tell us the reason
Youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars
Trying to light up the dark?
Who are we?
Just a speck of dust within the galaxy
Woe is me
If we're not careful turns into reality
Don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
Turn the page
Maybe we'll find a brand new ending
Where we're dancing in our tears
And, God, tell us the reason
Youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season
And the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars
Trying to light up the dark?
And I thought I saw you out there crying
And I thought I heard you call my name
And I thought I heard you out there crying
Just the same
Oh yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
God, give us the reason
Youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars
Trying to light up the dark?
And I thought I saw you out there crying
And I thought I heard you call my name
And I thought I heard you out there crying
But are we all lost stars
Trying to light up the dark?
But are we all lost stars
Trying to light up the dark?
A few stolen moments is all that we share
You've got your family and they need you there
Though I've tried to resist being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you
It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own
But each time I try, I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you
You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy
I've got to get ready just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night for feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yes, I'm saving all my love
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you
No other woman is gonna love you more
'Cause tonight is the night that I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yeah, I'm saving all my lovin'
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you
For you
For you
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me
You belong with me
Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile
That can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while
Since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?
She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one
Who understands you?
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me
On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year)
You can find it here
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
"Please bring me my wine"
He said, 'We haven't had that spirit here
Since 1969"
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, 'We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device"
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
"Relax, " said the night man
"We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave"
Just because I wander 'round the places we would go
Hoping that I'd run into you one last time
Just because I never took your picture off my phone
Doesn't mean that you're still on my mind
Just because I accidentally slipped and said your name
Well, I heard your song, it makes me insecure
Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same
Doesn't mean I love you anymore
Am I lying to myself again
When I say you're not the best I've ever had
Am I lying to myself again
When I say that I'm not missing you so bad
Just because I'm on my knees and swearing I would change
And I'd do anything to hear you say, "I'm yours"
Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same
Doesn't mean I love you anymore
Am I lying to myself again
When I say you're not the best I've ever had
Am I lying to myself again
When I say that I'm not missing you so bad
Just because I'm on my knees and swearing I would change
And do anything to hear you say, "I'm yours"
Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same
Doesn't mean I love you anymore, more
Doesn't mean I love you anymore (anymore, anymore)
Doesn't mean I love you anymore
Making my way downtown
Walking fast, faces pass and I'm homebound
Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making a way through the crowd
And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight
It's always times like these when I think of you
And wonder if you ever think of me
'Cause everything's so wrong, and I don't belong
Living in your precious memory
'Cause I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
Oh, 'cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight
And I, I don't wanna let you know
I, I drown in your memory
I, I don't wanna let this go
I, I don't
Making my way downtown
Walking fast, faces pass and I'm homebound
Staring blankly ahead, just making my way
Making a way through the crowd
And I still need you
And I still miss you
And now I wonder
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass us by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you, oh-oh
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
If I could just hold you tonight
Baby, take my hand
I want you to be my husband
'Cause you're my Iron Man
And I love you 3000
Baby, take a chance
'Cause I want this to be something
Straight out of a Hollywood movie
I see you standing there
In your Hulk outerwear
And all I can think
Is where is the ring
'Cause I know you wanna ask
Scared the moment will pass
I can see it in your eyes
Just take me by surprise
And all my friends, they tell me they see
You're planning to get on one knee
But I want it to be out of the blue
So make sure I have no clue
When you ask
Baby, take my hand
I want you to be my husband
'Cause you're my Iron Man
And I love you 3000
Baby, take a chance
'Cause I want this to be something
Straight out of a Hollywood movie
Now we're having dinner
And baby you're my winner
I see the way you smile
You're thinking about the aisle
You reach in your pocket
Emotion unlocking
And before you could ask
I answer too fast
And all my friends they tell me they see
You're planning to get on one knee
So now I can't stop thinking about you
I figured out all the clues

Got on board a westbound 747
Didn't think before deciding what to do
Oh, that talk of opportunities, TV breaks and movies
Rang true, sure rang true
Seems it never rains in southern California
Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before
It never rains in California
But girl, don't they warn ya?
It pours, man, it pours
Out of work, I'm out of my head
Out of self respect, I'm out of bread
I'm underloved, I'm underfed
I wanna go home
It never rains in California
But girl, don't they warn ya?
It pours, man, it pours
Will you tell the folks back home I nearly made it?
Had offers but don't know which one to take
Please don't tell 'em how you found me
Don't tell 'em how you found me
Gimme a break, give me a break
Seems it never rains in southern California
Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before
It never rains in California
But girl, don't they warn ya?
It pours, man, it pours
I see you driving your car
Down to school
Your lips are so fine
And you're looking so cool
I know you've noticed me too
And if I'll be honest with you now
Maybe I'm thinking maybe
If you need a lover
Let me know and let me in
I could treat you better
Steal you roses every day
I might not have a fancy car
But I fancy you
So gimme a chance
If you need a lover baby
They look at me
When I'm looking at you
I don't give a damn
Cause it's all I can do
Please don't go breaking my heart
Tell me you're aching for me now
Baby baby
If you need a lover
Let me know and let me in
I could treat you better
Steal you roses every day
I might not have a fancy car
But I fancy you
So gimme a chance
If you need a lover baby
Any flowers ain't your pain
I got so much love to give you babe
As long as you feel the same way
You know we can do
Whatever you want
You just need to either
Let me come inside
Or leave me standing in the rain
If you need a lover
Let me know and let me in
I could treat you better
Steal you roses every day
I might not have a fancy car
But I fancy you
So gimme a chance
If you need a lover baby
Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game
Some people think
That the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before
That life's a bore
So full of the superficial
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah
Some people search for a fountain
Promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them
Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
With no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, you, you
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah
If I ain't got you with me, baby, oh, ooh
Said nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me, baby
The day we met
Frozen I held my breath
Right from the start
I knew that I'd found a home for my heart
Beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer
I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath, every hour has come to this
One step closer
I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
I love you for a thousand more
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
One step closer
I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
Another summer day
Has come and gone away
In Paris and Rome
But I wanna go home, mmm
May be surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel all alone
Just wanna go home
Oh, I miss you, you know
And I've been keeping all the letters
That I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
I'm fine baby, how are you?
Well I would send them but I know
That it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that
Another airplane
Another sunny place
I'm lucky I know
But I wanna go home
Mmm, I got to go home
Let me go home
I'm just too far
From where you are
I wanna come home
And I feel just like
I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not
Come along with me
That this was not your dream
But you always believed in me
Another winter day
Has come and gone away
In even Paris and Rome
And I wanna go home
Let me go home
And I'm surrounded by
A million people I
I still feel alone
Oh, let me go home
Oh, I miss you, you know
Let me go home
I've had my run
Baby, I'm done
I gotta go home
Let me go home
It'll all be all right
I'll be home tonight
I'm coming back home
Have you told me all? I've got things to say
Hey, I'm talking to ya we got things to do
We got plans to make
And I wanna take you with me
Yeah, I wanna take you with me
But a far-off gaze is wide in me
Can you feel it?
And if you can't tell I'm a restless girl
What are you hearing?
Pack it all away, pack it all in one suitcase
I got all I need, all I need to be free
Pack it all away, pack it all in one suitcase
I got all I need, all I need to be free
Pack it all away, pack it all in one suitcase
I got all I need, all I need, I'm flying
Pack it all away, pack it all in one suitcase
I got all I need, all I need to be free
Pack it all away, pack it all in one suitcase
I got all I need, all I need, I'm flying
Bring the beat in
Honey honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me I just melt away
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts)
But I know (it's gonna take the real work) oh-oh
Nothing's perfect but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears and finally you put me first
Baby, it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need to make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top
Ooh, come on, baby
You put my love on top top top top top
You put my love on top
Ooh, ooh
Come on, baby
You put my love on top top top top top
You put my love on top
My love on top
Baby, baby I can hear the wind whipping past my face
As we dance the night away
And boy your lips taste like a night of champagne
As I kiss you again and again and again and again
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts)
But I know (it's gonna take the real work) oh-oh
Nothing's perfect but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears and finally you put me first
Baby, it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need to make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top
Ooh, baby
You put my love on top top top top top
You put my love on top
Ooh ooh
Come on, baby
You put my love on top top top top top
Put my love on top
My love on top
Baby, it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only thing I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls
When I need you, baby, everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top
Baby, you're the one that I love
Baby, you're all I need
You're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls
When I need you everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top
Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're the one that I need
You're the only man I see
Baby, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls
When I need you everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top
Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're the one that I need
You're the only one I see
Baby, baby it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls
When I need you everything stops
Finally, you put my love
I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me too
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need, and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can
Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can, oh
Better than he can
Better than he can
Look into my eyes
You will see, what you mean to me
Search your heart, search your soul
When you find me there, you'll search no more
Don't tell me it's not worth trying for
You can't tell me it's not worth dying for
You know it's true (you know it's true)
Everything I do
I do it for you
Yeah, yeah
Look in to your heart, you will find
There is nothing there to hide
Take me as I am, take my life
I would give it all, I would sacrifice
Don't tell me it's not worth fighting for
I can't help it, there's nothing I want more
You know it's true
Everything I do
I do it for you
There's no love, like your love
And no other, could give me more love
There's nowhere, unless you're there
All the time, all the way
You can't tell me it's not worth trying for
Just can't help it, there's nothing I want more
Oh, I would fight for you, yeah, I'd lie for you
Walk the wire for you, yeah, I'd die for you
You know it's true
Everything I do
I do for you
This is the anthem
Told the world I need everything and some, yeah
Two girls that's a tandem
She gon' do all it for me when them bands come
Got it all, yeah, I'm young, rich, and handsome
Uh, this shit is not random
Everybody ain't got it, understand son, yeah
This shit is not random
Woah okay
It's my world and I do what I like to
I know she gon' be ready when I slide through
If you forgot I got it, I'll remind you
'Cause I got what they got I am talking times two
Disagree with me and you've been lied to
I am nothing like you, and no I'm not the type to
Follow bullshit y'all give the hype to
I can see the fakes, so when I look in your direction
Understand I'm seeing right through
You're hollow, you follow
Everybody's not the real McCoy
Worldwide, yeah, they feel the boy
California out to Georgia, Florida then up to Illinois
When I listen to your music I just feel annoyed
Haters, I don't understand them
Bred Jordan Ones from two thousand and one (OG)
Today I think I want a Phantom
If I don't get it I'ma throw a fucking tantrum, woah
This is the anthem
Told the world I need everything and some, yeah
Two girls that's a tandem
She gon' do it all for me when them bands come
Got it all, yeah, I'm young, rich, and handsome
This shit is not random (nope)
Everybody ain't got it, understand, son, yeah (sorry)
This shit is not random
Now imagine it, put the hours in and stay passionate
Wasn't blowing money, I was stacking it
Figured what the fuck I want to do in life and practiced it
Pay attention, none of this is happening by accident
Listen, I don't slack a bit
Game plan solid, no cracks in it
Said I want a billion now nothing less is adequate
Grab and check, cashing it
I was born addicted to the money
Difference is now if finally found a way to manage it
What you think I'm paid for nothing?
You must be mistaken someone
I had to go make that fund and I'm trying to be great at something
Spend not saving nothing
Flying from the bay to London
They say that money talks but you're not saying nothing
Now try and shade me, I'm like I guess
Why yes, you drive a Toyota, please define flex
Sign CDs and I sign breasts
Understand, to these female fans, I'm sex
Listen
This is the anthem
Told the world I need everything and some, yeah
Two girls that's a tandem
She gon' do it all for me when them bands come
I got it all, yeah, I'm young, rich, and handsome
This shit is not random
Everybody ain't got it, understand, son, yeah
This shit is not random
Abilene, Abilene
Prettiest town I've ever seen
Women there don't treat you mean
In Abilene, my Abilene
I sit alone, most every night
Watch those trains pull out of sight
Don't I wish they were carryin' me
Back to Abilene, my Abilene
Abilene, Abilene
Prettiest town I've ever seen
Women there don't treat you mean
In Abilene, my Abilene
Crowded city, there ain't nothin' free
Nothin' in this town for me
Wish to the Lord that I could be
In Abilene, sweet Abilene
Abilene, Abilene
Prettiest town I've ever seen
Women there don't treat you mean
In Abilene, my Abilene
In Abilene, my Abilene
A well I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
A yes I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy
Well a poor boy's chances
For a pretty girl's glances
Are sometimes very few
Though I've got no money
If you'll be my honey
Here's what I'll offer you
A well I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
A yes I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy
We met by chance and I knew at a glance
That I'd found my destiny
Now I want to carry you off and marry you
If you will agree
And I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
Yes I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy
Well you ask me 'bout the clothes I wear
And you ask me why I grow my hair
And you ask me why I'm in a band
I dig doin' one night stands
And you wanna see me do my thing
All you gotta do is plug me into high
I said high
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage, high voltage
High voltage rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll
You ask me why I like to dance
And you ask me why I like to sing
And you ask me why I like to play
I got to get my kicks some way
And you wanna know what I'm all about
Come on, let me hear you shout high
I said high
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage, high voltage
High voltage rock 'n' roll
Rock 'n' roll
I said high, I said high
Waaaah!
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage, high voltage
High voltage rock 'n' roll
Stars, bulbs, baby
Burn the spotlight, put the lights out, turn me on
High voltage rock 'n' roll
High voltage rock 'n' roll
Wine, women and song
High voltage, high voltage
Plugged in and turned on, it's sparkin' and
High voltage rock 'n' roll
The war was over
And the spirit was broken
The hills were smokin'
As the men withdrew
We stood on the cliffs,
Oh and watched the ships,
Slowly sinking to their rendezvous
They signed a treaty
And our homes were taken
Loved-ones forsaken,
They didn't give a damn.
Try to raise a family
End up an enemy
Over what went down on the Plains of Abraham.
Acadian driftwood,
Gypsy tailwind
They call my home,
The land of snow
Canadian cold front,
Movin' in
What a way to ride,
Oh what a way to go
Then some returned,
To the motherland
The high command,
Had them cast away
Some stayed on,
To finish what they started
They never parted,
They're just built that way
We had kin livin',
South of the border
They're a little older,
And they been around
They wrote in a letter
Life is a whole lot better
So pull up your stakes, children,
And come on down
Acadian driftwood,
Gypsy tailwind
They call my home,
The land of snow
Canadian cold front,
Movin' in
What a way to ride,
Oh what a way to go
Fifty under zero when the day became a threat
My clothes were wet
And I was drenched to the bone
Then out ice fishin', mmm,
Too much repetition
Make a man want to leave
The only home he's known
Sailed out of the Gulf,
Headed for St. Pierre
Nothing to declare,
All we had was gone
Broke down along the coast oh
What hurt the most
When the people there said
"You better keep movin' on"
Acadian driftwood,
Gypsy tailwind
They call my home,
The land of snow
Canadian cold front,
Movin' in
What a way to ride,
Oh what a way to go
Everlastin' summer
Filled with ill-contempt
This government
Had us walkin' in chains
This isn't my turn
This isn't my season
Can't think of one good reason
To remain oh
We worked in the sugar fields
Up from New Orleans
It was ever-green
Up until the flood
You could call it an omen
Point ya where ya goin'
Set my compass North
I got winter in my blood
Acadian driftwood,
Gypsy tailwind
They call my home,
The land of snow
Canadian cold front,
Movin' in
What a way to ride,
Oh what a way to go
Sais tu, Acadie j'ai le mal do pays
Ta neige, Acadie, fait des larmes au soleil
J'arrive Acadie, teedle um, teedle um, teedle oo
J'arrive Acadie, teedle um, teedle um, teedle oo
J'arrive Acadie, teedle um, teedle um, teedle oo
J'arrive Acadie, teedle um, teedle um, teedle oo
J'arrive Acadie, teedle um, teedle um, teedle oo
You got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mr. In-between
You got to spread joy up to the maximum
Bring gloom down to the minimum
And have faith, or pandemonium
Liable to walk upon the scene
To illustrate his last remark
Jonah in the whale, Noah in the ark
What did they do, just when everything looked so dark?
Man, they said we better ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mr. In-between
No, do not mess with Mister In-Between
Do you hear me?
Oh, listen to me children and-a you will hear
About the eliminatin' of the negative
And the accent on the positive
And gather 'round me children if you're willin'
And sit tight while I start reviewin'
The attitude of doin' right
You've gotta ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mr. In-between
You got to spread joy up to the maximum
Bring gloom down to the minimum
Otherwise (otherwise), pandemonium
Liable to walk upon the scene
To illustrate my last remark
Jonah in the whale, Noah in the ark
What did they say
Say when everything looked so dark?
Man, they said we better ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mr. In-between
No, do not mess with Mister In-Between
If you like to gamble
I tell you, I'm your man
You win some, lose some
It's all the same to me
The pleasure is to play
Makes no difference what you say
I don't share your greed
The only card I need
Is the Ace of Spades
The Ace of Spades
Playing for the high one
Dancing with the devil
Going with the flow
It's all a game to me
Seven or eleven
Snake eyes watching you
Double up or quit
Double stake or split
The Ace of Spades
The Ace of Spades
You know I'm born to lose
And gambling's for fools
But that's the way I like it, baby
I don't want to live forever
And don't forget the joker
Pushing up the ante
I know you got to see me
Read 'em and weep
The dead man's hand again
I see it in your eyes
Take one look and die
The only thing you see
You know it's gonna be
The Ace of Spades
The Ace of Spades, uh
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me
Jai guru deva, om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox they
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe
Jai guru deva, om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing
Through my open ears inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe
Jai guru deva, om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Jai guru deva
Jai guru deva
Jai guru deva
Jai guru deva
Jai guru deva
Jai guru deva
They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally
Well, I'll bet you I'ma gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can't never tell
The movie's gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well
Well, I hope you come to see me in the movie
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally
We'll make a scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And begging down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsin'
All I'll have to do is act naturally
Well, I'll bet you I'ma gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can't never tell
The movie's gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well
Well, I hope you come to see me in the movie
Then I'll know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally
I see dead man grins
Seven deadly sins
Couldn't keep his mouth closed in the house of chins
The all seeing eye that recognize the rap clones
Plus possess the pin to crack the pyramid stone
Its the call of the wild that's why my words rank high
Drop the verse for nine planets
That fell from the sky
Do or die you and I get fly with rap expressions
With the one two three four five
In the session with the lesson
Cause in bass and treble we trust
With the rebels orally ready in case we bust
And write a power chord and if the place be plush
We kick the old school like Julio Iglesias
Tapes we push be straps with no safety catch
We attack like a bullet till your face relax
And think about it
If you ain't got the class to flee
Be mentally ready for jurass-catastrophy
Now its time for me to rise
The lyric utilizer
Down like fertilizer
Quick to improvise
A style that can surprise ya
Your eyes is on the prize
We can go line for line
I ain't hard to find
While we break your spine
My mild style reclines
I'm laid back
All that talk you need to save that
The payback is all the reason that I'm flexing
The feds rocking like we X-Men
You say you want action satisfaction
The brothers with the positive reaction
The crew with style that's on top of the pile
J5's gonna rock a long long while
We get set
Who's up next to pull to a fast one
Lyrically connect the dots and then I blast one
Now who wants action satisfaction
Lyrics remind you of bass I'm everlasting
Casting plagues my styles crossing the switchblades
My momma shoulda named me Grace cause I'm amazingly
Blazing with the fire and desire
I'm world renowned I gets down to the wire
If any child of mine gets out a line boastin'
My style of rhyme covers you like calamine lotion
Lifted out like vine motion I spend time stroking
You still drink a dime potion and dime boasting
But now my rhymes open brims a spirituality
We be giving power that you can share with your family
Aerodynamically cutting through danger
Ripping your narrow mentality nothing but flavor
The moral of my oral ammunition rendition
Tuna fish on a Marc seven collision
We be forever keeping niggas on they P's and Q's
And the be's who snooze leave diseased and bruised
I see through your crews like an x-ray tube
And gamma rayed your function
Left you with assumption
That we be the butter clique
We smothered with the action satisfaction that's guaranteed to be Jurassic
The lights are on, but you're not home
Your mind is not your own
Your heart sweats, your body shakes
Another kiss is what it takes
You can't sleep, you can't eat
There's no doubt, you're in deep
Your throat is tight, you can't breathe
Another kiss is all you need
Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You know you're gonna have to face it, you're addicted to love
You see the signs, but you can't read
You're running at a different speed
Your heart beats in double time
Another kiss and you'll be mine
A one-track mind, you can't be saved
Oblivion is all you crave
If there's some left for you
You don't mind if you do
Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You know you're gonna have to face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
You're addicted to love
You're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it
Might as well face it
Might as well face it
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
The lights are on, but you're not home
Your will is not your own
Your heart sweats, your teeth grind
Another kiss and you'll be mine
Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You know you're gonna have to face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it
Might as well face it
Might as well face it
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"
It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
(I bless the rain)
I bless the rains down in Africa
(I bless the rain)
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
(Ah, gonna take the time)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Lyrical murderer, I'm servin em like two scoops of chocolate.

No need to say mo', check the flow.
Rage in effect once mo', so now ya know.

Ain't no doubt about it, I'm the undisputed.
So what you uhh, wanna do is back on up.
I'll tap that butt, wax the cuts, pass the bucks.
So put your money on the bread winner.
I kick lyrics so dope that the brothers call em head spinners.
I got the tongue that has outdone anyone.
From the rising to the setting of the sun.
Or the moon, I consume the room with doom.
When I hear the kick of a 808 bass, poom
Boom, bam, God, damn!
I'm hittin so hard you could say it's a grand, slam, dunk, punks.
Get broken off for chunk when they feel the funk.
Of the rhythm (fresh) that I give em.
Let it hit em, split em, did it now I'm rid of em, yeah.
I put that on my unborn kids.
Rage in effect so you know how it is.
I rock rough and stuff with my afro puffs. (Rage!)
Rock on with your bad self.
I rock rough and stuff with my afro puffs. (Rage!)
Rock on with your bad self.
Now ever since my debut, I've continued to lay you.
Flat on your back from the raps that I spat, spit.
Oh shit, I'm the shit!
You can't get with the Rage then tough tit-ty.
I pi-ty the fool, that gets.
With the lyrical murderer cause my shit is rude. (ooooh!)
You wanna get with the wickedness, with that.
Big body girl that's kickin it, rippin it apart like Jason.
You'll be chasin a dream like Freddy.
Are you ready for the cream de la creme?
I'm steam pressuring those who ain't measuring up.
I keep competitors stuck.
In the muck with they butt up, what you wanna nut up.
Like cashew, don't you know that I will mash you? For real,
That's the deal, I'm straight out of Farmville, VA.
(So what you gotta say?)

Get with the uh, toughest, toughest. (Rage!)
Get with the uh, wickedness, roughest.
I am the uh, wickedness. (Rage)
Yeah, one-nine-nine-four.
The indo blow and the grass grow.
Snoop Doggy Dogg still don't love a hoe.
But you gotta give credit when credit is due.
Women back down and bow down to my motherfucking homegirl.
The Lady Of Rage.
She rocks rough and stuff with the Afro Puffs.
Handcuffed and she busts.
And trick biatch, she's guaranteed to tear shit up.
You know what I'm saying?
Thought I almost died in my dream again (baby, almost died)
Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again
I'm fallin' in too deep (oh)
Without you, don't wanna sleep (fallin' in)
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I want you next to me
This time, I'll never leave
I wanna share babies
Protection, we won't need
Your body next to me
Is just a memory
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
Without you, I can't sleep
Insomnia, don't leave, oh
Talk to me, without you I can't breathe
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distracting my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say
Oh, baby, where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
Never comin' down, uh
I was runnin' away from facin' reality, uh
Wastin' all of my time on livin' my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you baby
I'll be livin' in Heaven when I'm inside of you
It was definitely a blessing wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again
Oh, baby, where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I said, baby, I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah
I know it's all my fault
Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall
Then said you were wrong for me
I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (to you)
Can't hide the truth, I stayed with her in spite of you
You did some things that you regret, still ride for you
'Cause this house is not a home
Without my baby, where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
And I said, baby, I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time I won't break your heart, your heart, no
After midnight
We're gonna let it all hang out
After midnight
We're gonna chug-a-lug and shout
We're gonna 'cause talk and suspicion
Give an exhibition
Find out what it is all about
After midnight
We're gonna let it all hang out
After midnight
Gonna shake your tambourine
After midnight it's gonna be peaches and cream, hmm
We're gonna cause talk and suspicion
Give an exhibition
Find out what it is all about
After midnight
We're gonna let it all hang out
We're gonna 'cause talk and suspicion
Give an exhibition
Find out what it is all about
After midnight
We're gonna let it all hang out
After midnight
We're gonna let it all hang out
Well, I dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming
Sayin' something about a queen
There were peasants singin' and drummers drumming
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowin' to the sun
That was floating on the breeze
Look at mother nature on the run in the nineteen seventies
Look at mother nature on the run in the nineteen seventies
I was lyin' in a burned-out basement
With a full moon in my eyes
I was hopin' for replacement
When the sun burst through the sky
There was a band playin' in my head
And I felt like getting high
I was thinkin' about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie
Thinkin' about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie
Well, I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships lying
In the yellow haze of the sun
There were children crying and colors flying
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream
The loading had begun
Flyin' mother nature's silver seed
To a new home in the sun
Flyin' mother nature's silver seed
To a new home
Now won't you listen honey, while I say,
How could you tell me that you're goin' away?
Don't say that we must part,
Don't break your baby's heart
You know I've loved you for these many years,
Loved you night and day,
Oh! honey baby, can't you see my tears?
Listen while I say
After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had
There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Someday, when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away
After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You're gonna feel blue, and you're gonna feel sad
You're gonna feel bad
And you'll miss, and you'll miss,
And you'll miss the bestest pal you ever had
There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
But baby, think what you're doin'
I'm gonna haunt you so, I'm gonna taunt you so
It's gonna drive you to ruin
After you've gone, after you've gone away.
I moved away and changed my number when I did it
I hoped that cutting you off would make me feel different
I know I'm weaker than I probably seem
I can't lie, I blame you for everything
All pins and needles when I meet somebody new and I
Get all choked up whenever they ask about you and I
Feel so pathetic and I want to scream
I can't lie, I blame you for everything
And I think you know exactly what I mean
You really fucked me up
Screaming at my mirror like I'm fucking drunk
Question who I am and what I could have done
Because you're the one who told me that you were in love, oh, oh
You really fucked me up
Close my eyes, can't think of anything but us
Made me feel like I'm the one who's not enough
But you're the one who told me that you were in love
Try to forget how you could never meet me in the middle
How all the pain that you inflicted made me feel so little
A little tired of remembering
I can't lie, I blame you for everything
You'd change so quick, you'd start a fight then you'd be saying sorry
Made me look like a fucking idiot at every party
You made me sick, it's so embarrassing
I can't lie, I blame you for everything
I think you know exactly what I mean
You really fucked me up
Screaming at my mirror like I'm fucking drunk
Question who I am and what I could have done
'Cause you're the one who told me that you were in love
You really fucked me up
Close my eyes, can't think of anything but us
Made me feel like I'm the one who's not enough
But you're the one who told me that you were in love
You really fucked me up
Screaming at my mirror like I'm fucking drunk
Question who I am and what I could have done
'Cause you're the one who said that you were in love
How can I just let you walk away?
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath, with you, ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all
How can you just walk away from me?
When all I can do is watch you leave
'Cos we've shared the laughter and the pain and even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all
So take a look at me now, oh there's just an empty space
And there's nothin' left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Ooh, take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face
Instrumental
I wish, I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you so many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all
So take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space
And there's nothin' left here to remind me, just the memory of your face
Now take a look at me now, 'cos there's just an empty space
But to wait for you, is all I can do and that's what I've got to face
Take a good look at me now, 'cos I'll still be standin' here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
It's the chance I've gotta take
Instrumental
Take a look at me now
Ah! Sweet mystery of life
At last I've found thee
Ah! I know at last the secret of it all;
All the longing, seeking, striving, waiting, yearning
The burning hopes, the joy and idle tears that fall!
For 'tis love, and love alone, the world is seeking,
And 'tis love, and love alone, that can repay!
'Tis the answer, 'tis the end and all of living
For it is love alone that rules for aye!
Love, and love alone, the world is seeking,
For 'tis love, and love alone, that can repay!
'Tis the answer, 'tis the end and all of living
For it is love alone that rules for aye!
First thing we'd climb a tree
And maybe then we'd talk
Or sit silently
And listen to our thoughts
With illusions of someday
Cast in a golden light
No dress rehearsal
This is our life
And that's where the hornet stung me
And I had a feverish dream
With revenge and doubt
Tonight, we smoke them out
You are ahead by a century
You are ahead by a century
You are ahead by a century
Stare in the morning shroud
And then the day began
I tilted your cloud
You tilted my hand
Rain falls in real time
And rain fell through the night
No dress rehearsal, this is our life
But that's when the hornet stung me
And I had a serious dream
With revenge and doubt
Tonight, we smoked them out
You are ahead by a century
You are ahead by a century
You are ahead by a century
You are ahead by a century
You are ahead by a century
You are ahead by a century
And disappointing you is gettin' me down
I loved you for a long, long time
I know this love is real
It don't matter, how it all went wrong
That don't change the way I feel
And I can't believe that time is
Gonna heal this wound that I'm speaking of
There ain't no cure
There ain't no cure
There ain't no cure for love
I'm aching for you baby
I can't pretend I'm not
I need to see you naked
In your body and your thought
I've got you like a habit
And I'll never get enough
There ain't no cure
There ain't no cure
There ain't no cure for love
There ain't no cure for love
There ain't no cure for love
All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky
The holy books are open wide
The doctors working day and night
But they'll never ever find that cure for love
There ain't no drink no drug
(Ah tell them, angels)
There's nothing pure enough to be a cure for love
I see you in the subway and I see you on the bus
I see you lying down with me, I see you waking up
I see your hand, I see your hair
Your bracelets and your brush
And I call to you, I call to you
But I don't call soft enough
There ain't no cure
There ain't no cure
There ain't no cure for love
I walked into this empty church I had no place else to go
When the sweetest voice I ever heard, whispered to my soul
I don't need to be forgiven for loving you so much
It's written in the scriptures
It's written there in blood
I even heard the angels declare it from above
There ain't no cure,
There ain't no cure,
There ain't no cure for love
There ain't no cure for love
There ain't no cure for love
All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky
The holy books are open wide
The doctors working day and night
But they'll never ever find that cure (cure for love)
That cure for love
(No cure for love)
(There ain't no cure for love)
(No cure for love, there ain't no cure for love)
Ah yeah, I'm with this
I'm just gon' sit here laid back to this nice mellow beat, you know
And drop some smooth lyrics 'cause it's '88
Time to set it straight, know what I'm saying
And ain't no half stepping, word, I'm ready
Rappers stepping to me, they want to get some
But I'm the Kane, so yo, you know the outcome
Another victory, they can't get with me
So pick a BC date 'cause you're history
I'm the authentic poet to get lyrical
For you to beat me, it's gonna take a miracle
And stepping to me, yo that's the wrong move
So what you on, Hobbs, dope or dog food?
Competition, I just devour like a pitbull against a Chihuahua
'Cause when it comes to being dope, hot damn
I got it good, now let me tell you who I am
The B-I-G D-A-double D-Y K-A-N-E
Dramatic, Asiatic, not like many
I'm different, so don't compare me to another
'Cause they can't hang, word to the mother
At least not with the principal in this pedigree
So when I roll on you rappers, you better be ready to die
Because you're petty, you're just a butter knife, I'm a machete
That's made by Ginzu, wait until when you try to front
So I can chop into your body
Just because you try to be basing Friday the 13th
I'mma play Jason, no type of joke, gag, game, puzzle or riddle
The name is Big Daddy, yes, Big not little
So define it, here's your walking papers, sign it
And take a walk as the Kane start to talk, 'cause
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
My rhymes are so dope and the rappers be hoping
To sound like me, so soon I'll have to open
A school of MCing, for those who want to be in
My field in court, then again on second thought
To have MC's coming out sounding so similar
It's quite confusing for you to remember
The originator, and boy do I hate a perpetrator
But I'm much greater, the best
Oh yes, I guess suggest the rest should fess
Don't mess or test your highness
Unless you just address with best finesse
And bless the paragraph I manifest
Rap Prime Minister, some say sinister
Non-stopping the groove, until when it's the climax
And I max, relax and chill
Have a break from a take of me acting ill
Brain cells are lit, ideas start to hit
Next the formation of words that fit
At the table I sit, making it legit
And when my pen hits the paper, ah shit
I stop and stand strong over MC's
And devour with the power of Hercules
Or Samson, but I go further the length
'Cause you could scalp my cameo and I'll still have strength
And no, that's not a myth, and if you try to riff
Or get with the man with the given gift of gab
Your vocab, I'll only ignore
Be sleeping on your rhymes 'til I start to snore
You can't awake me or even make me
Fear you, son, 'cause you can't do me none
So think about it if you're trying to go
When you want to step to me, I think you should know that
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
I appear right here and scare and dare
A mere musketeer that would dare to compare
Put him in the rear, back there where he can't see clear
Get a beer, idea or near stare, yeah
So on to be, want to be competition
Trying to step to me, must be on a mission
Up on the stage is where I'ma get you at
You think I'm losing? Psst, picture that
Ain't no half steppin'
Ain't no half steppin'
Ain't no half steppin'
Ain't no half steppin'
Mister Cee, step to me
The name is Big Daddy, you know, as in your father
So when you hear a def rhyme, believe that I'm the author
I grab the mic and make MC's evaporate
The party people say, damn, that rapper's great
The creator conductor of poetry
Et cetera, et cetera, it ain't easy being me
I speak clearly so you can understand
Put words together like letter, man
Now that's dictation, proceeding to my innovation
Not like the other MC's, that are an imitation
Or an animation, a cartoon to me
But when I'm finished, I'm sure that you are soon to see
Reality, my secret technique
Because I always speak with mentality
I put my title in your face, dare you to base
And if you try and come get it, yo, I'ma show you who's with it
So if you know like I know, instead of messing around
Play like Roy Rogers and slow down
Just give yourself a break or someone else will take
Your title, namely me because I'm homicidal
That means murder 'cause I'm about to hurt another MC
That try to get with me, I'll just break him and bake him and rake him
And take him and mold him and make him
Hold up the peace sign, Assalam Walaikum
Captured effortlessly
That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
Did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was you
Holdin' me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go
And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
You filled my heart with a kiss
You gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone
And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ain't nobody (nobody)
Loves me better (loves me better)
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way (nobody)
Ain't nobody (ain't nobody)
Loves me better, than you
I wait for night time to come
To bring you to me
I can't believe I'm the one
I was so lonely
I feel like no one could feel
I must be dreamin'
I want this dream to be real
I need this feelin'
I make my wish upon a star
And hope this night will last forever
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ain't nobody (ain't nobody)
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way (nobody, baby)
Ain't nobody (nobody, baby)
Loves me better (nobody makes me feel)
Ain't nobody
Loves me better, than you
At first you put your arms around me
Then you put your charms around me
I can't resist this sweet surrender
Oh, my nights are warm and tender
We stare into each other's eyes
And what we see is no surprise
Got a feelin' most would treasure
And a love so deep we cannot measure
Ain't nobody (nobody)
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody (ain't nobody)
Loves me better (nobody)
Ain't nobody
Loves me better (nobody, baby)
Ain't nobody (nobody, baby)
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Ain't nobody
Loves me better (nobody)
Ain't nobody (ain't nobody)
Loves me better (ain't nobody)
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way (nobody, baby)
Ain't nobody
Loves me better (ain't nobody)
Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Ain't nobody (nobody, baby)
Loves me better (ain't nobody, baby)
Makes me happy (ain't nobody, baby)
Makes me feel this way (ain't nobody)
Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Ain't nobody
Loves me better (makes me feel this way)
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Bill collector's at my door
What can you do for me?
Hey
No romance without finance
No romance without finance
Boy, nothin' in life is free
That's why I'm askin' you what can you do for me
I've got responsibilities
So I'm lookin' for a man whose got money in his hands
'Cause nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'
You got to have somethin' if you wanna be with me
Oh, life is too serious, love's too mysterious
A fly girl like me needs security
'Cause ain't nothin' goin' on but the rent
You got to have a J-O-B if you wanna be with me
Ain't nothin' goin' on but the rent
You got to have a J-O-B if you wanna be with me
No romance without finance

Boy, your silky ways are sweet
But we're only wastin' time if your pockets are empty
I've got lots of love to give
But I will have to avoid you if you're unemployed
'Cause nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'
You got to have somethin' if you wanna be with me

There was Adam, happy as a man could be
Till Eve got him messin' with that old apple tree
Ain't that just like a woman?
Yeah, ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time
Lot took his wife down to the cornerstore for a malted
She wouldn't mind her business, boy did she get salted
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Yeah, that's just like a woman, they'll do it every time
Samson thought Delilah was on the square
Till one night she clipped him for all his hair
Ain't that just like a woman?
Yes, that's just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time, sure will
From our history books we all learned
That Nero fiddled while Rome was burned
Ain't that just like a woman?
Hey, just like a woman?
That's just like a woman?
They'll do it every time
Marie Antoinette met
Some hungry cats at the gate
They was crying for bread
She said, "Let them eat cake"
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Yeah, that's just like a woman?
They'll do it every time, I'm sure will
You can buy a woman clothes
And give her money on the side
No matter what you do
She ain't never satisfied
It's just like a woman?
That's just like a woman?
It's just like a woman?
Many, they'll do it every time
Honey you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers go through rain
But how can love go through pain
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-arity
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be
You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby til I don't want to see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger
Ain't that peculiar
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity
I cried so much just like a child that's lost its home
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears
Now ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity
Ain't it peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be
Said I don't understand it baby
It's so strange sometimes
I know you wanna leave me
But I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg and plead for your sympathy
I don't mind, 'cause you mean that much to me
Ain't too proud to beg and you know it (sweet darlin')
Please don't leave me girl (don't you go)
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl (don't you go)
Now I heard a cryin' man
Is half a man, with no sense of pride
But if I have to cry to keep you
I don't mind weepin' if it'll keep you by my side
Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me girl (don't you go)
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl (don't you go)
If I have to sleep on your doorstep
All night and day
Just to keep you from walkin' away
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand
'Cause I wanna keep you, any way I can
Ain't too proud to beg (sweet darlin')
Please don't leave me girl (don't you go)
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl (don't you go)
Now I've gotta love so deep, in the pit of my heart
And each day it grows more and more
I'm not ashamed to come, and plead to you baby
If pleadin' keeps you from, walkin' out that door
Ain't too proud to beg and you know it (sweet darlin')
Please don't leave me girl (don't you go)
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl (don't you go)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (sweet darling')
Every morning, every evening
Ain't we got fun?
Not much money, oh, but honey
Ain't we got fun?
The rent's unpaid, dear
We haven't a car
But in any way, dear
We'll stay as we are
Even if we owe the grocer
Don't we have fun
Tax collector's getting closer
Still we have fun
There's nothing surer
The rich get rich and the poor get poorer
In the meantime, in between time
Ain't we got fun?
Don't we have fun?
Still we have fun
Even if we owe the grocer
Don't we have fun?
Tax collector's getting closer
Ooh, what fun
There's nothing surer
The rich get rich and the poor get poorer
In the meantime, in between time
Don't we have fun?
You're just like the ocean
I've got a million emotions
I'm breathing underwater
You're love is deeper than no other
We go higher and higher
Keep flying and flying
We crash and we burn
We keep trying and trying
We're higher and higher
Fight fire with fire
We'll never give up
Long as we got each other
'Cause when I'm with you I need no air
Take my breath away now I don't care
I can breathe without air
I can breathe without air
Take my breath away now I don't care
I can breathe without air
I can breathe without air
(You're my, you're my, you're my air)
I'll be there in a heartbeat
'Cause I love the way you love me
(Love me, love me, love me)
We go higher and higher (higher)
Fight fire with fire (fire)
We'll never give up
Long as we got each other (hey)
'Cause when I'm with you I need no air
(I don't need no air)
Take my breath away now I don't care
(I don't even care)
'Cause when I'm with you I need no air
I can breathe without air
(You're my, you're my, you're my air)
I can breathe without air
(You're my, you're my, you're my air) you're my air, oh
I can breathe without air
You're just like the ocean
I've got a million emotions
I'm breathing underwater
I can breathe without air
Oh, Alabama
The devil fools with the best laid plan
Swing low, Alabama
You got the spare change
You got to feel strange
And now the moment is all that it meant
Alabama, you got the weight on your shoulders
That's breaking your back
Your Cadillac has got a wheel in the ditch
And a wheel on the track
Oh, Alabama
Banjos playing through the broken glass
Windows down in Alabama
See the old folks tied in white ropes
Hear the banjo
Don't it take you down home?
Alabama, you got the weight on your shoulders
That's breaking your back
Your Cadillac has got a wheel in the ditch
And a wheel on the track
Oh, Alabama
Can I see you and shake your hand
Make friends down in Alabama
I'm from a new land
I come to you and see all this ruin
What are you doing Alabama?
You got the rest of the union to help you along
What's going wrong?
Well show me the way
To the next whiskey bar
Oh don't ask why
Oh don't ask why
Show me the way
To the next whiskey bar
Oh don't ask why
Oh don't ask why
For if we don't find
The next whiskey bar
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die
I tell you, I tell you
I tell you we must die
Oh moon of Alabama
We now, must say goodbye
We've lost, our good old Mama
And must have whiskey
Oh, you know why
Oh, moon of Alabama
We now must say goodbye
We've lost, our good old Mama
And must have whiskey
Oh, you know why
I'm Alabamy bound,
There'll be no heebie jeebies hangin' round.
Just gave the meanest ticket mam on earth
All I'm worth,
To put my tootsies in an upper berth.
Just hear that choo-choo sound,
I know that soon we're gonna cover ground,
And then I'll holler so
The world will know,
Here I go!
I'm Alabamy bound!
I can hear that choo-choo whistle blow,
Watch that engine when we start to go!
Now we're in Baltimore,
Knockin' at Dixie's door!
What's that bill?
Louisville!
We passed that before!
Field o' cotton, tell me where I am,
Hear that fella yellin', "Alabam!".
Mammy!
Mammy!
Get your kisses ready for your honey lamb!
I'm Alabamy bound,
There'll be no heebie jeebies hangin' round.
Just gave the meanest ticket mam on earth
All I'm worth,
To put my tootsies in an upper berth.
I'm just a lucky lucky hound
To have someone to put my arms around!
That's why I'm shoutin' for the world to know,
Here I go!
I'm Alabamy bound!
I was a workshop owner in the gulch for the people
And I offered myself to the world
I was a workshop owner
I was a workshop owner
I was a diesel fixer, fixed a diesel, diesel fixed me
What a weasel
And baby was a workshop owner
Baby was a workshop owner
Baby and me were ripe for the pickin'
That was the day we ran into Albert Flasher
It was a cold, snowy, rainy afternoon
And we were sittin' there in high school, my school
And Michael was a moonbeam maker
And Michael was a moonbeam maker
I was a diesel fixer, fixed a diesel, diesel fixed me
What a weasel, oh no
Baby was a workshop owner
Baby was a workshop owner
Baby and me were ripe for the pickin'
That was the day we ran into Albert Flasher
I was a workshop owner in the gulch for the people
And I offered myself to the world
I was a workshop owner

Well, them ol' boys town in Texas chew copenhagen
Wash it all down with that Coors
Ain't a bit bashful about speakin' their minds
They'll tell you what's theirs and what's yours
There's Waylon and there's Willie
They own about half the state
And sing of her glories all in song
Talk about your lovers and your fighters
Wild brahma bull riders
The whole thing takes a holt and goes on
Ride with me Jesus, help me pull this heavy load
Don't let her slip, don't let her slide
You answer all our questions further down this muddy road
Old cowboys cross the Great Divide
Divide
Well up north, it's saddle broncs and it's hockey and honkytonks
Old Wilf Carter 78s
Dumb stuff like chores when it's 20 below
They're the things that a country boy hates
Too much damn wind and not enough whiskey
Drives them ol' northern boys flat wild
And he may go to Hell or even Vancouver
He'll always be Alberta's child
Ride with me Jesus, help me pull this heavy load
Don't let her slip, don't let her slide
You answer all our questions further down this muddy road
Old cowboys cross the Great Divide
Divide
Ride with me Jesus, help me pull this heavy load
Don't let her slip, don't let her slide

Come on and hear, come on and hear
Alexander's Ragtime Band
Come on and hear, come on and hear
It's the best band in the land
They can play a bugle call
Like you never heard before
So natural that you want to go to war
That's just the bestest band what am, Honey Lamb
Come on along, come on along
Let me take you by the hand
Up to the man, up to the man
Who's the leader of the band
What's it all about, Alfie?
Is it just for the moment we live?
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?
Are we meant to take more than we give?
Or are we meant to be kind?
And if only fools are kind, Alfie
Then I guess it is wise to be cruel
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie
What will you lend on an old golden rule?
As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie
I know there's something much more
Something even non-believers can believe in
I believe in love, Alfie
Without true love we just exist, Alfie
Until you find the love you've missed, you're nothing, Alfie
When you walk, let your heart lead the way
And you'll find love any day, Alfie
Oh it's so funny to be seeing you after so long, girl.
And with the way you look I understand
That you are not impressed.
But I heard you let that little friend of mine
Take off your party dress.
I'm not going to get too sentimental
Like those other sticky valentines,
Cause I don't know if you've been loving somebody.
I only know it isn't mine.
Alison, I know this world is killing you.
Oh, Alison, my aim is true.
Well I see you've got a husband now.
Did he leave your pretty fingers lying
In the wedding cake?
You used to hold him right in your hand.
I'll bet he took all he could take.
Sometimes I wish that I could stop you from talking
When I hear the silly things that you say.
I think somebody better put out the big light,
Cause I can't stand to see you this way.
Alison, I know this world is killing you.
Oh, Alison, my aim is true.
My aim is true.

There must be some kind of way outta here
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Business men, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody offered his word
Hey, hey
No reason to get excited
The thief, he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But, uh, but you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us stop talkin' falsely now
The hour's getting late, hey
Hey
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too
Well, uh, outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl, hey
All along the watchtower
All along the watchtower
What else should I be?
All apologies

I love everything about you, you're imperfectly perfect
Everyone's itching for beauty, but just scratchin' the surface
Lost time is never found, can the DJ please reverse it?
In life we pay for change, let's make every second worth it
Anything can work if you work it when people say you don't deserve it
Then don't give in, 'cause hate may win some battles, but love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun while the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you
It's only right that
All around the world people want to be loved

I'll know we're all blues
All Shades, all hues, all blues
Some blues are sad
But some are glad,
Dark-sad or bright-gald
They're all blues
All shades, all hues, all blues
The color of colors
The blues are more than a color
They're a moan of pain
A Taste of strife
And a sad refrain
A game which lif is pplayin'
Blues can be the livin' dues
We're all a-payin'
Yeah, Oh Lord
In a rainbow
A summer day that's fair
A parayer is prayed
A lament that's made
BREAK
Some shade of blues is there;
Blue heaven's hue,
They're all blues!
INSTRUMENTAL
Talkin' 'bout the sea and the sky
Andi'm talkin' 'bout you and I
The sea, the sky
For you and I
And I know we're all blues
All shades,
All hues,
All blues
Sea, sky, you and I
See the sky, you and I
All Blues
All shades, all hues, all blues
When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone
Living alone
I think of all the friends I've known
But when I dial the telephone
Nobody's home
All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And loves so distant and obscure
Remains the cure
All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live
All by myself
Anymore
When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone
All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live
Don't wanna live
By myself, by myself
Anymore
By myself
Anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live
I never, never, never
Needed anyone
I'm not content to be with you in the day time
Girl, I want to be with you all of the time
The only time I feel alright is by your side
Girl, I want to be with you all of the time
All day and all of the night
All day and all of the night
All day and all of the night
I believe that you and me last forever
Oh yeah, all day and night time yours, leave me never
The only time I feel alright is by your side
Girl, I want to be with you all of the time
All day and all of the night
All day and all of the night
Oh, come on
I believe that you and me last forever
Oh yeah, all day and night time yours, leave me never
The only time I feel alright is by your side
Girl, I want to be with you all of the time
All day and all of the night
All day and all of the night (time)
All day and all of the night
All I do is dream of you
The whole night through
With the dawn I still go on
Dreamin' of you
You're every thought, you're everything
You're every song I ever sing
Summer or winter, (?) and spring
And were there more than twenty-four hours in a day
They'd be spent in sweet content just dreamin' away
When skies are grey, when skies are blue
Morning, noon and night-time, too
All I do the whole day through is dream of you, oh (?)
When skies are grey, even when they're blue
And were there more than twenty-four hours in a day
Oh that'd be spent in sweet content, dreaming away
Oh, when skies are grey, when skies are blue
In the morning (night-time too)
All I do the whole day through is dream (I'm dreaming, dreaming a dream)
Of (just dreaming I dream a little dream) you, yu-yu-yu, yu-yu-yu, yu-yu-yu
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
When I want you in my arms
When I want you and all your charms
Whenever I want you, all I have to do is
Dream, dream, dream, dream
When I feel blue in the night
And I need you to hold me tight
Whenever I want you, all I have to do is
Dream
I can make you mine, taste your lips of wine
Anytime, night or day
Only trouble is, gee whiz
I'm dreamin' my life away
I need you so that I could die
I love you so and that is why
Whenever I want you, all I have to do is
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream
I can make you mine, taste your lips of wine
Anytime, night or day
Only trouble is, gee whiz
I'm dreamin' my life away
I need you so that I could die
I love you so and that is why
Whenever I want you, all I have to do is
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Now I ain't lookin' to compete with you
Beat on, cheat on, mistreat you
Simplify you, classify you
Deny, defy, mystify you
All I really want to do
Is baby, be friends with you
Baby, be friends with you
Now I ain't lookin' to fight with you
Frighten you or uptighten you
Drag you down or drain you down
Chain you down or bring you down
All I really want to do
Is baby, be friends with you
Baby, be friends with you
I ain't lookin' to block you up
Dock or rock or lock you up
Analyze you, categorize you
Finalize or advertise you
All I really want to do, yeah
Is baby, be friends with you
Baby, be friends with you
I don't want to straight-face you
Race or chase or track or trace you
Or disgrace you or displace you
Or define you or confine you
All I really want to do, yeah
Is baby, be friends with you
Baby, be friends with you
Now I don't want to meet your kin
Make you spin or do you in
Or select you or dissect you
Or inspect you or reject you
All I really want to do
Is baby, be friends with you
Baby, be friends with you
I found a guy, told me I was a star
He held the door held my hand in the dark
And he's perfect on paper but he's lying to my face
Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?
And there's one more boy, he's from my past
We fell in love but it didn't last
'Cause the second I figure it out he pushes me away
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway
And I say that I'm through but this song's still for you
All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best but what can I say
All I have is myself at the end of the day
But shouldn't that be enough for me?
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
And I miss the days
When I was young and naive
I thought the perfect guy would come and find me
Now happy ever after it don't come so easily
All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me? Oh
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best but what can I say
All I have is myself at the end of the day
And all I want is for that to be okay
All my exes live in Texas
And Texas is a place I'd dearly love to be
But all my exes live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee
Rosanna's down in Texarkana
Wanted me to push her broom
Sweet Eileen's in Abilene
She forgot I hung the moon
And Allison's in Galveston
Somehow lost her sanity
And Dimples who now lives in Temple's
Got the law looking for me
All my exes live in Texas
And Texas is a place I'd dearly love to be
But all my exes live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee
I remember that old Frio River
Where I learned to swim
But it brings to mind another time
Where I wore my welcome thin
By transcendental meditation
I go there each night
But I always come back to myself
Long before daylight
All my exes live in Texas
And Texas is a place I'd dearly love to be
But all my exes live in Texas
Therefore I reside in Tennessee
Some folks think I'm hidin'
It's been rumored that I died
But I'm alive and well in Tennessee
Da Da, ooooh
Well, my friends, the time has come
To raise the roof and have some fun

What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for you
My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh
Give me all of you, oh
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you
I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh
All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather have nothing at all
All or nothing at all
If it's love, there ain't no in between
Why begin then cry for something that might have been?
No, I'd rather, rather have nothing at all
Please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't you smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart, it may grow dizzy and fall
And if I fell under the spell of your call
I would be, I'd be caught in the undertow
So you see, I have got to say no, no
All or nothing at all
All or nothing at all
Nothing at all
There ain't nothing at all
Nothing at all
There she stood in the street
Smiling from her head to her feet
I said hey, what is this
Now baby, maybe she's in need of a kiss
I said hey, what's your name baby
Maybe we can see things the same
Now don't you wait or hesitate
Let's move before they raise the parking rate
All right now baby, it's all right now
All right now baby, it's all right now
I took her home to my place
Watching every move on her face
She said look, what's your game baby
Are you tryin' to put me in shame
I said slow don't go so fast
Don't you think that love can last
She said love, Lord above
Now you're tryin' to trick me in love
All right now baby, it's all right now
All right now baby, it's all right now
All right now baby, it's all right now
All right now baby, it's all right now
All right now baby, it's all right now
All right now baby, it's all right now
All right now baby, it's all right now
All right now baby, it's all right now

Oh, well, a-bless my soul, but what's wrong with me?
I'm itchin' like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm actin' wild as a bug
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm-mm, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, well, my hands are shaky, and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck?
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm-mm, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, please, don't ask me what's upon my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I feel fine
When I'm near the girl that I love best
My heart beats, so it scares me to death
When she touched my hand, what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm-mm, yeah, yeah, yeah
My tongue gets tied when I try to speak
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this body of mine
That's to have that girl that I love so fine
When she touched my hand, a-what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm-mm, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mm-mm, yeah, yeah, I'm all shook up
Hmmm
Loving you is wonderful
Something like a miracle
Rest assured I feel the same way you do
Meeting you isn't hard
With you I can let down my guard
Stay secure that's all I'm asking from you
(Stay secure)
I wish I had words to tell (I wish)
This feeling that I know so well
But I don't, I don't
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
I've always been curious
Meeting someone serious
Looking for someone who loves like me
But the day I stopped my search
It seemed that you were put on Earth
To show me everything I could not see
I wish I could find a way
To tell you how I felt that day
But I can't (I just can't)
I can't
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
Hmmm, oh
Knowing him, loving him
Showing him that I'm all him
Living and forgiving and
I would do it all again
Genuine, seraphim
Sweeter than cinamon
Heaven-sent gentleman
Sent him here for loving him
Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
He's all that I'll ever need
He's got a hold on me
I love you
Oh I don't wanna live without you
You're all that I can say, hey
Loving you is wonderful
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
I wish you love
And happiness
I guess I wish
You all the best
I wish you don't
Do like I do
And ever fall in love with
Someone like you
Cause if you fell
Just like I did
You'd probably walk around the block like a little kid
But kids don't know
They can only guess
How hard it is
To wish you happiness
I guess that love
Is like a Christmas card
You decorate a tree
You throw it in the yard
It decays and dies
And the snowmen melt
Well I once knew love
I knew how love felt
Yeah I knew love
Love knew me
And when I walked
Love walked with me
And I got no hate
And I got no pride
Well, I got
So much love that I cannot hide
Yeah, I got
So much love that I cannot hide
Say you drive a Chevy
Say you drive a Ford
You say you drive around the town till you just get bored
And then you change your mind
For something else to do
And your heart gets bored with your mind and it changes you
Well it's a doggone shame
And it's an awful mess
I wish you love
I wish you happiness
I wish you love
I wish you happiness
I guess I wish
You all the best
All the gold in California
Is in the bank in the middle of Beverly Hills
In somebody else's name.
So if you're dreamin' about California,
It don't matter at all where you've played before.
California's a brand-new game.
Tryin' to be a hero, winding up a zero,
Can scar a man forever right down to your soul.
Living on the spotlight can kill a man outright
'Cause everything that glitters is not gold.
All the gold in California
Is in the bank in the middle of Beverly Hills
In somebody else's name.
So if you're dreamin' about California,
It don't matter at all where you've played before.
California's a brand-new game.
All the lovely ladies in their finery tonight
I wish that I could know them one by one
All the handsome gentlemen with loving on their minds
Strolling in to take the ladies home
Bless you all and keep you on the road to tenderness
Heaven can be yours just for now.
All the gentle strangers who by nature do not smile
To everyone who cannot hold a pen
To all you heavy rounders with a headache for your pains
Who dread the thought of going 'round the bend
Bless you all and keep you on the road to better things
Heaven can be yours just for now.
To all the lovely ladies in their finery tonight
I wish that I could kiss you while you knit
To all the ones who learn to live with bein' second-guessed
Whose job it is to give more then to get
Bless you all and keep you with the strength to understand
Heaven can be yours just for now.
To all the little dreamers with a dream that cannot last
To all the sleeping giants who must wake
To every man who answers to the letter of the law
And all the rest imprisoned by mistake
Bless you all and keep you with the faith to let it pass
Heaven can be yours just for now
To all the lonely sailors who have trouble beeing seen
To all of you with heartache that remains
Maybe sometime later you might swim back into shore
If someone could relieve you of your chains
Bless you all and keep you all on the land or on the sea
Heaven can be yours, just for now
Time and again I've longed for adventure,
Something to make my heart beat the faster.
What did I long for? I never really knew.
Finding your love I've found my adventure,
Touching your hand, my heart beats the faster,
All that I want in all of this world is you.
You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long.
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.
You are the angel glow that lights a star,
The dearest things I know are what you are.
Some day my happy arms will hold you,
And some day I'll know that moment divine,
When all the things you are, are mine!
When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you all the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way
Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
That's how deep it goes, if it's real
When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in-between years, come what may
Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you
All the way
All the way
Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
That's how deep it goes, if it's real
When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in-between years, come what may
Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you
All the way
All the way
I'm gonna love you all the way
Well, Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
Speed jive, don't want to stay alive
When you're 25
And Wendy's stealing clothes from Marks and Sparks
And Freddy's got spots from ripping off the stars
From his face
Funky little boat race
Television man is crazy

Too many snags

All things dull and ugly,
All creatures short and squat,
All things rude and nasty,
The Lord God made the lot.
Each little snake that poisons,
Each little wasp that stings,
He made their brutish venom.
He made their horrid wings.
All things sick and cancerous,
All evil great and small,
All things foul and dangerous,
The Lord God made them all.
Each nasty little hornet,
Each beastly little squid
Who made the spikey urchin?
Who made the sharks? He did!
All things scabbed and ulcerous,
All pox both great and small,
Putrid, foul and gangrenous,
The Lord God made them all.
Amen.
And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties?
A hand-me-down dress from who knows where
To all tomorrow's parties
And where will she go and what shall she do
When midnight comes around
She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown
And cry behind the door
And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties?
Why silks and linens of yesterday's gowns
To all tomorrow's parties
And what will she do with Thursday's rags
When Monday comes around?
She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown
And cry behind the door
And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties?
For Thursday's child is Sunday's clown
For whom none will go mourning
A blackened shroud, a hand-me-down gown
Of rags and silks, a costume
Fit for one who sits and cries
For all tomorrow's parties
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair
And eyes that would tempt any man
Then she came and sat down at my table
And then she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside
Then we danced and she whispered, "I need you
Take me away from here and be my man"
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it
The reflection of my wedding band
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home
We met in the springtime when blossoms unfold
The pastures were green and the meadows were gold
Our love was in flower as summer grew on
Her love like the leaves now have withered and gone
The roses have faded, there's frost at my door
The birds in the morning don't sing anymore
The grass in the valley is starting to die
And out in the darkness the whippoorwills cry
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh Lord, if you hear me, please hold to my hand
Oh, please understand
Oh, where has she gone to? Oh, where can she be?
She may have forsaken some other like me
She promised to honor, to love, and obey
Each vow was a plaything that she threw away
The darkness is falling, the sky has turned gray
A hound in the distance is starting to bey
I wonder, I wonder what she's thinking of
Forsaken, forgotten without any love
Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh Lord, if you hear me, please hold to my hand
Oh, please understand
Alls my life I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life I
Hard times like, yah!
Bad trips like, yah!
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Homie, you fucked up
But if God got us then we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin'! And let me tell you bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my mama I love her but this what I like
Lord knows, twenty of 'em in my Chevy
Tell 'em all to come and get me, reapin' everything I sow
So my karma come in heaven, no preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before, nigga
When our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go, nigga?"
And we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga
I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
What you want you, a house? You, a car?
40 acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it I know when it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinkin' of my partner put the candy, paint it on the regal
Diggin' in my pocket ain't a profit, big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I see cool
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs, I write 'til I'm right with God
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before, nigga
When our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go, nigga?"
And we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga
I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Do do doop dum
Do do doop do doop da dum
Do do doop dum
Do do doop do doop da dum
Do do doop do do do
Do do doop do doop da dum
Do do doop dum
Do do doop do doop da dum
We were as one, babe

And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine

Our love will never die
No you'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely

Always late with your kisses
Won't you come to my arms sweet darlin' and stay
You're always late with your kisses
Why, oh why do you want to do me this way
How long do you think that I can wait
When you know you're always late
Always late with your kisses
Why, oh why do you want to do me this way
Always late, always late
Always late, always late
How long do you think that I can wait
When you know you're always late
Always late with your kisses
Why, oh why do you want to do me this way
Always late with your kisses
Won't you come to my arms sweet darlin' and stay
You're always late with your kisses
Why, oh why do you want to do me this way
I said, why oh why do you want to do me this way
Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out for the best
And
Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the light side of life
If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing
And
Always look on the bright side of life
(Come on)
Always look on the right side of life
For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow
So always look on the bright side of death
A just before you draw your terminal breath
Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
You'll see it's all a show
Keep 'em laughin' as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you
And
Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the right side of life
(C'mon Brian, cheer up)
Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life
I mean, what have you got to lose?
You know, you come from nothing
You're going back to nothing
What have you lost? Nothing
Always look on the right side of life
Nothing will come from nothing, ya know what they say
Cheer up ya old bugga c'mon give us a grin (Always look on the right side of life)
There ya are, see
It's the end of the film
Incidentally this record's available in the foyer (Always look on the right side of life)
Some of us got to live as well, you know
(Always look on the right side of life)
Who do you think pays for all this rubbish
(Always look on the right side of life)
They're not gonna make their money back, you know
I told them, I said to him, Bernie, I said they'll never make their money back
(Always look on the right side of life)
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel, oh, second best (you did, you did)
Girl, I'm sorry I was blind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
When you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
And give me
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind (you were always on my mind)
You were always on my mind
Why do people fall in love
And then end up crying
Why do lovers walk away from themselves
When their hearts are breaking
Why does lovin' sometimes never stay long
Why does kissing this time mean you'll be gone
Why does gladness become sadness
Things that I don't get
Someones always sayin' goodbye
I believe it hurts when we cry
Don't we know partings never so easy
And with all the achings inside
I believe some hearts will survive
Tryin' hard to pretend that were gonna be fine
I could never really love
Someone else but you
(No one else but you)
I have never wanted anything else
But a love so true
But just like a dream that comes in the night
In the morning you were out of my sight
Turned away from me, sadly as I see
Away from where I stand
I walk along the city streets you used to walk along with me
And every step I take reminds me of just how we used to be
Well, how can I forget you girl?
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
As shadows fall I pass the small cafe where we would dance at night
And I can't help recalling how it felt to kiss and hold you tight
Well, how can I forget you girl?
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
I was born to love her and I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me
If you should find you miss the sweet and tender love we used to share
Just come back to the places where we used to go and I'll be there
Well, how can I forget you girl?
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
I was born to love her and I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me
'Cause there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
Am I blue?
Am I blue?
Ain't these tears
In these eyes tellin' you?
Am I blue?
You'll be too
If your schemes like your dreams
Done fell through
Was a time
I was her only one
Now I am
The sad and lonely one, oh yes I am
Was I gay?
Till today
Now she's gone and we're through
Am I blue?
Was a time
I was her only one
Now I am
The sad and lonely one
I'm such a lonely one
Was I gay?
Till today
Now she's gone and we're through
Am I blue?
Babe, tomorrow's so far away
There's something I just have to say
I don't think I could hide what I'm feelin' inside
Another day, knowin' I love you
And I, I'm getting too close again
I don't wanna see it end
If I tell you tonight, would you turn out the lights
And walk away knowin' I love you?
I'm gonna take you by surprise
And make you realize, Amanda
I'm gonna tell you right away
I can't wait another day, Amanda
I'm gonna say it like a man
And make you understand, Amanda
I love you
And I feel like today's the day
I'm looking for the words to say
Do you wanna be free, are you ready for me
To feel this way?
I don't wanna lose ya
So, it may be too soon, I know
The feeling takes so long to grow
If I tell you today, will you turn me away
And let me go?
I don't wanna lose you
I'm gonna take you by surprise
And make you realize, Amanda
I'm gonna tell you right away
I can't wait another day, Amanda
I'm gonna say it like a man
And make you understand, Amanda
Oh, girl
You and I
I know that we can't wait
And I swear, I swear it's not a lie, girl
Tomorrow may be too late
You, you and I, girl
We can share a life together
It's now or never
And tomorrow may be too late
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh
And feelin' the way I do
I don't wanna wait my whole life through
To say I'm in love with you
Five, six, seven, eight
Come on babe, why don't we paint the town?
And all that jazz
I'm gonna rouge my knees and roll my stockings down
And all that jazz
Start the car, I know a whoopee spot
Where the gin is cold but the piano's hot
It's just a noisy hall, where there's a nightly brawl
And all that jazz
Skidoo
And all that jazz
Hotcha
Whoopee
And all that jazz
Slick your hair and wear your buckle shoes
And all that jazz
I hear that Father Dip is gonna blow the blues
And all that jazz
Hold on hon, we're gonna bunny-hug
I bought some aspirin down at United Drug
In case you shake apart and want a brand new start
To do that jazz
Find a flask, we're playin' fast and loose
And all that jazz
Right up here is where I store the juice
And all that jazz
Come on babe, we're gonna brush the sky
I betcha Lucky Lindy never flew so high
'Cause in the stratosphere, how could he lend an ear
To all that jazz?
Oh, you're gonna see your sheba shimmy-shake
And all that jazz
Oh, she's gonna shimmy 'til her garters break
And all that jazz
Show her where to park her girdle
Oh, her mother's blood'll curdle
If she'd hear her baby's queer
For all that jazz
All that jazz
Come on babe, why don't we paint the town?
(Oh, you're gonna see your Sheba shimmy shake)
And all that jazz (and all that jazz)
I'm gonna rouge my knees and roll my stockings down
(Oh, she's gonna shimmy 'til her garters break)
And all that jazz (and all that jazz)
Start the car, I know a whoopee spot
(Show her where to park her girdle)
Where the gin is cold but the piano's hot
(Oh, her mother's blood will curdle)
It's just a noisy hall, where there's a nightly brawl
(If she'd hear her baby's queer)
And all that jazz
No, I'm no one's wife
But oh, I love my life
And all that jazz
That jazz
He would spend it on the ponies
He would spend it on the girls
Buy his mother gin and roses
For her poor old henna'd curls
And when his wife said "Hey now!
What did you get for me?"
He socked her in the choppers
Such a sweet, sweet guy was he!
And her tears flowed like wine
Yes, her tears flowed like wine
She's a real sad tomato
She's a busted Valentine
Knows her mama done told her
That her man is darned unkind
How he loved the old race horses
He would bet them every day
One day he caught a winner
And the cabbage wasn't hay!
He indulged in fancy spending
Ordered rings, cars and furs
But alas, alack
Like a stab in the back
She found out they were not hers!
And her tears flowed like wine
Yes, her tears flowed like wine
She's a real sad tomato
She's a busted Valentine
Knows her mama done told her
That her man is darned unkind
He got mixed up with a Maisie
He got mixed up with a Flo
So Flo shoved him in the river
He'll not get mixed up no more!
His wife then draped herself in black
That showed her figure fine
Then she cussed him out
The two-faced guy
No insurance could she find!
And her tears flowed like wine
Yes, her tears flowed like wine
She's a real sad tomato
She's a busted Valentine
Knows her mama done told her
That her man is darned unkind!
I'm not scared of dying
And I don't really care
If it's peace you find in dying
Well, then let the time be near
If it's peace you find in dying
And if dying time is near
Just bundle up my coffin cause
It's cold way down there
I hear that's it's cold way down there
Yeah, crazy cold way down there
And when I die and when I'm gone
There'll be one child born
In this world, carry on, to carry on
Now troubles are many
They're as deep as a well
I can swear there ain't no heaven
But I pray there ain't no hell
Swear there ain't no heaven
And I pray there ain't no hell
But I'll never know by living
Only by dying will tell
Yes, only by dying will tell, yeah
Only my dying will tell
And when I die and when I'm gone
There'll be one child born
In this world to carry on, to carry on
Give me my freedom for as long as I be
All I ask of the living is to have no chains on me
All I ask of living is to have no chains on me
And all I ask of dying is to go naturally
Only want to go naturally
Here I go, ah
Hey, hey
Here comes the devil, right behind
Look out children, here he come
Here he come
Hey
Don't want to go by the devil
Don't want to go by the demon
Don't want to go by Satan
Don't want to die uneasy
Just let me go naturally
And when I die and when I'm dead, dead and gone
There'll be one child born
In our world to carry on, to carry on, yeah, yeah
Since you been gone
I been hangin' around here lately
With my mind messed up
Jumped in my car tried to clear my mind
Didn't help me
I guess I'm all messed up now baby
Soon as I jumped into my ride
Those memories start to play
A song comes on the radio
And there you are baby once again
It's just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And it's all because of you
Since you been gone
I keep thinkin' about you baby
Gets me all choked up
This heart of mine keeps
Dreamin' of you and it's crazy
You'd think I'd had enough
As soon as I get you out my head
I'm in your car again
Just one request from the radio
I'm back in love sugar once again
It's just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And it's all because of you
Here comes the strings
Then somebody sings
Only takes a beat
And then it starts killin' me darlin'
Only takes one note, I tell ya,
From that radio
It's just
Another
Lonely
Love Song.
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause i just got paid
How I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way
I got in town a month ago, I seen a lotta girls since then
If I could meet 'em I could get 'em but as yet I haven't met 'em
That's why I'm in the shape I'm in
Here another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
How I wish I had someone to talk to

Instead of being my deliverance, she had a strange resemblance
To a cat named Frankenstein

Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
How I wish I had some someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way (one more time)
I'd like to dedicate this to all the creative, righteous children
I have some food in my bag for you
Not that edible food, the food you eat, no
Perhaps some food for thought
Since knowledge is infinite
It has infinitely fell on me so um...
It was a stormy night, you know, the kind where the lightnin' strike
And I was hangin' out with some my artsy friends
Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh wee
The night was long, the night went on, people coolin' out until the
Break of dawn
Incense was burnin' so I'm feelin' right, aight
See I pick my friends like I pick my fruit
My Granny told me that when I was only a youth
I don't walk around trying to be what I'm not
I don't waste my time trying to get what you got
I work at pleasin' me
'Cause I can't please you and that's why I do what I do
My soul flies free like a willow tree
Doo wee, doo wee, doo wee
And if you don't want to be down with me, you don't want to pick from my
Apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me, then you don't want to pick from my
Apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me, then you don't want to pick from my
Apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me, you just don't want to be down
I have a hoe
And I take it everywhere I go
'Cause I'm plantin' seeds so I reap what I sow, ya know, ya know
On and on, and on and on, my cypher keep's movin' like a rollin' stone
I can't control the soul flowin' in me
Ooh wee, ooh wee, oh wee
See I picks my friends like I pick my fruit
My Granny told me that when I was only a youth
I don't walk around trying to be what I'm not
I don't waste my time trying to get what ya got
I work at pleasin' me
'Cause I can't please you and that's why I do what I do
My soul flies free like a willow tree
Doo wee, doo wee, doo wee
And if you don't want to be down with me, you don't want to pick from
My apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me, you don't want to pick from
My apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me, you don't want to pick from
My apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me, you just don't want to be
Down
Oh my my my, oh my my my, oh my my my, my my my my
I picks my friends like I pick my fruit
My Granny told me that when I was only a youth
I don't walk around trying to be what I'm not
I don't waste my time trying to get what you got
I work at pleasin' me
'Cause I can't please you, and that's why I do what I do
My soul flies free like a willow tree
Doo wee, doo wee, doo wee
And if you don't want to be down with me, you don't want to pick from
My apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me, dum dum diddy
And if you don't want to be down with me, you don't want to pick from
My apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me, you just don't want to be
Down
You just don't want to be down
You just don't want to be down, down, down
You just don't want to be down
You just don't want to be down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear-skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth
And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say, "Come dance with me"
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems
At seventeen
A brown eyed girl in hand-me-downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, "Pity, please, the ones who serve
They only get what they deserve"
And the rich-relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly
Remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality
And dubious integrity
Their small-town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received
At seventeen
To those of us who knew the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
When dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me
We all play the game, and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
They call and say, "Come dance with me"
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me
At seventeen
The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold
Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall
Babe, baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you
I said baby, you know I'm gonna leave you
I'll leave you when the summertime
Leave you when the summer comes a-rollin'
Leave you when the summer comes along
Babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, baby
Baby, I wanna leave you
I ain't jokin', woman, I've got to ramble
Oh yeah
Baby, baby, I be leavin'
We really got to ramble
I can hear it callin' me the way it used to do
I can hear it callin' me back home
Babe, oh
Babe, I'm gonna leave you
Oh, baby
You know, I've really got to leave you
Oh, I can hear it callin' me
I said don't you hear it callin' me the way it used to do?
Oh
I know, I know
I know I never, never, never, never, never gonna leave you, babe
But I gotta go away from this place
I gotta quit you, yeah
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Don't you hear it callin' me?
Oh, woman, woman, I know, I know
It feels good to have you back again
And I know that one day, baby, it's really gonna grow, yes, it is
We gonna go walkin' through the park every day
Come what may, every day
Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my babe
I'm gonna leave you, go away
Oh
So good, see, baby
It was really, really good
You made me happy every single day
But now, I've got to go away
Oh, oh, oh
Baby, baby, baby
That's when it's callin' me
I said that's when it's callin' me back home
Mmm baby face
You've got the cutest little mmm baby face
There's not another who could take your place
Mmm baby face
My poor heart's jumpin'
You sure have started somethin'
Mmm baby face
I'm up in heaven
When i'm in your firm embrace
I didn't need a shove 'cause I
I fell in love with your pretty baby face
Mmm baby face
You've got the cutest little
Mmm baby face
There's not another who could take your place
Mmm hmm baby face
My poor heart's jumpin'
You sure have started somethin'
Mmm baby face
I'm up in heaven
When i'm in your firm embrace
I didn't need a shove 'cause I
I fell in love with your pretty baby face
Mmm baby face
You got the cutest baby face
There's not another who could take your place
My poor heart's jumpin'
You sure have started somethin'
You start my heart a jumpin'
Mmm baby face
I'm up in heaven
When i'm in your firmm embrace
I didn't need a shove 'cause I fell in love
With your pretty baby face
Baby, I need your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Although you're never near
Your voice I often hear
Another day, 'nother night
I long to hold you tight
'Cause I'm so lonely
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all you lovin'
Some say it's a sign of weakness
For a man to beg
Then weak I'd rather be
If it means having you to keep
'Cause lately I've been losing sleep
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all you lovin'
Empty nights echo your name
Whoa, sometimes I wonder
Will I ever be the same?
Oh yeah!
When you see me smiling, you know
Things have gotten worse
Any smile you might see
Has all been rehearsed
Darling, I can't go on without you
This emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside, darling
Makes me feel half alive
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours (yours) until the stars fall from the sky
Yours (yours) until the rivers all run dry
In other words, until I die
Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours (yours) until the sun no longer shines
Yours (yours) until the poets run out of rhyme
In other words, until the end of time
I'm gonna stay right here by your side
And do my best to keep you satisfied
Nothing in the world could drive me away
Every day, you'll hear me say
Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours (yours) until two and two is three
Yours (yours) until the mountain crumbles to the sea
In other words, until eternity
Baby, I'm yours (ooh)
'Til the stars fall from the sky
Baby, I'm yours
'Til the rivers all run dry
Baby, I'm yours
Until the sun no longer shines
Baby, I'm yours
Until the poets run out of rhyme
Baby, I'm yours
I guess that now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Oh, yeah
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now
Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong, just tell me the song
And I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back)
I want you back for good (want you back for good)
Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story (oh, no)
It wasn't good (no, no)
But in the corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation you excelled at being free
Can't you find a little room inside for me (can't you find, for me)
Whatever I said, whatever I did (whenever I'm wrong, I'll tell you)
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back)
I want you back for good (want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong, just tell me the song (whenever I'm wrong, I'll tell you)
And I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back)
I want you back for good (want you back for good)
And we'll be together, this time is forever (forever, girl)
We'll be fighting and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again
Whatever I said, whatever I did (whenever I'm wrong, I'll tell you)
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong, just tell me the song (whenever I'm wrong, I'll tell you)
And I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back)
See, I want you back for good (want you back for good)
whenever I'm wrong, I'll tell you
(I didn't mean it)
(I just want you back)
I want you back, want you back (want you back, want you back)
See, I want you back for good (want you back for good)
(Whenever I'm wrong, just tell me the song) whenever I'm wrong I'll tell you
(And I'll sing it)
(You'll be right and understood)
I want you back, want you back (want you back, want you back)
You see, I want you back for good (want you back for good)
Oh, yeah
I guess that now it's time she came back for good, yeah
Back in black
I hit the sack
I've been too long, I'm glad to be back
Yes, I'm let loose
From the noose
That's kept me hanging about
I've been looking at the sky
'Cause it's gettin' me high
Forget the hearse 'cause I never die
I got nine lives
Cat's eyes
Abusin' every one of them and running wild
'Cause I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black
Back in the back
Of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes, I'm in a bang
With a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
'Cause I'm back on the track
And I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So look at me now
I'm just makin' my play
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way
'Cause I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black
Well, I'm back, yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Take my love
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah
Well, I'm back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back
Back in black
Yes, I'm back in black
I've hit the sack
I see the bad moon a-risin'
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightnin'
I see bad times today
Don't go around tonight
Well it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
I hear hurricanes a-blowin'
I know the end is comin' soon
I fear rivers over flowin'
I hear the voice of rage and ruin
Don't go around tonight
Well it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise, alright
Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye
Well don't go around tonight
Well it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
Don't come around tonight
Well it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
You try so hard but you don't understand
Just what you will say when you get home
Because something is happening here but you don't know what it is
Do you, Mr. Jones?
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his"
And you say, "What's mine?" and somebody else says, "Well, what is?"
And you say, "Oh my God, am I here all alone?"
But something is happening and you don't know what it is
Do you, Mr. Jones?
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone
And something is happening here but you don't know what it is
Do you, Mr. Jones?
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you to all give a check
To tax-deductible charity organizations
Ah, you've been with the professors and they've all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You're very well-read, it's well-known
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is
Do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice, he asks you how it feels
And he says, "Here is your throat back, thanks for the loan"
And you know something is happening but you don't know what it is
Do you, Mr. Jones?
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "Now"
And you say, "For what reason?" and he says, "How"
And you say, "What does this mean?" and he screams back, "You're a cow!
Give me some milk or else go home"
And you know something's happening but you don't know what it is
Do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, you walk into the room like a camel, and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground
There ought to be a law against you comin' around
You should be made to wear earphones
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is
Do you, Mr. Jones?
Born on a mountain top in Tennessee
Greenest state in the land of the free
Raised in the woods, so he knew ev'ry tree
Kilt him a bar when he was only three
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier
Fought single-handed through the Injun War
'Til the Creeks was whipped and peace was in store
While he was handlin' this risky chore
Made himself a legend for evermore
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier
He give his word and he give his hand
That his Injun friends could keep their land
The rest of his life, he took the stand
That justice was due every redskin band
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier
He went off to Congress an' served a spell
Fixin' up the Governments an' laws as well
Took over Washington so we heered tell
An' patched up the crack in the Liberty Bell
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier
When he come home, his politickin' done
The western march had just begun
So he packed his gear an' his trusty gun
An' lit out grinnin' to follow the sun
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier
His land is biggest an' his land is best
From grassy plains to the mountain crest
He's ahead of us all, meetin' the test
Followin' his legend into the West
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier
Years ago, my heart was set to live, oh
And I've been trying hard against unbelievable odds
It gets so hard in times like now to hold on
But guns they wait to be stuck by, at my side is God
And there ain't no one going to turn me 'round
Ain't no one going to turn me 'round
There's people around who tell you that they know
And places where they send you, and it's easy to go
They'll zip you up and dress you down and stand you in a row
But you know you don't have to, you could just say no
And there ain't no one going to turn me 'round
Ain't no one going to turn me 'round
Ain't no one going to turn me 'round
Ain't no one going to turn me 'round
I've been built up and trusted
Broke down and busted
But they'll get theirs and we'll get ours if you can
Just-a hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Years ago, my heart was set to live, oh
Though I've been trying hard against strong odds
It gets so hard in times like now to hold on
Well, I'll fall if I don't fight, and at my side is God
And there ain't no one going to turn me 'round
Ain't no one going to turn me 'round
Ain't no one going to turn me 'round
Ain't no one going to turn me 'round
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Now that you're gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the memories of what love could be
If you were still here with me
You took me from the shelter of my mother, I had never known
Or loved any other
We kissed after taking vows
But that night on our honeymoon
We stayed in separate rooms
I wait in the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon
That you'll walk back through that door
And love me like you tried before
Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the dream of what love could be
If you were still here with me
Oh, don't you know that I wait
In the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon
That you'll walk back through that door
And love me like you tried before
Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the dream of what love could be
If you were still here with me
Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold

We took a boat to the land of dreams
Heaven on earth, they call it basin street
Do you have the time to listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once?
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone
No doubt about it
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid
Or am I just stoned?
I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Grasping to control
So I better hold on
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Or am I just stoned?
Something in my mind (wanna talk 'bout it)
Feelings deep inside (cannot suppress it)
This must be love, am not searching no more
I found the one for me e yeah
You are my destiny (You are my destiny )
I want to be the one you seek in the morning
Before you go to sleep at night

Oh, what a feeling
To wake up everyday, knowing I am loved by you
I can't believe it
What did I do to deserve someone to hold me like you do?
If nobody's perfect
Then all that I want is to be imperfect with you
'Cause you take me as I am
And I take you as you are
With your heart in weathered hands
And the bruises on my heart
That make me who I am
That make you who you are
Baby, when you take my hand
You show me that my scars are beauty marks
Oh, beauty marks
Beauty marks
I look in the mirror, and I see all my flaws
But you see light in all I do
Now I'm realizing that the uglyness I saw
There are pretty things to you
And I don't have to cover anything, I share it all
I don't have to hide from the truth
'Cause you take me as I am
And I take you as you are
With your heart in weathered hands
And the bruises on my heart
That make me who I am
That make you who you are
Baby, when you take my hand
You show me that my scars are beauty marks
Oh, beauty marks
Beauty marks
Now I know why you love me
So real, it feels like a dream
No looking back to the past
It was all part of the plan
I feel the love in your haze
Boy, when you touch me like that
The way you love every part
You show me my scars are beauty marks, beauty marks
Oh, they're beauty marks, beauty marks
'Cause you take me as I am
And I take you as you are
With your heart in weathered hands
And the bruises on my heart
That make me who I am
That make you who you are
Baby, when you take my hand
You show me that my scars are beauty marks
My baby makes me proud
Lord, don't she make me proud
She never makes a scene
By hangin' all over me in a crowd
'Cause people like to talk
Lord, don't they love to talk
But when they turn out the lights
I know she'll be leavin' with me
And when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad that I'm a man
Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors
My baby makes me smile
Lord, don't she make me smile
She's never far away
Or too tired to say, "I want you"
She's always a lady
Just like a lady should be
But when they turn out the lights
She's still a baby to me
'Cause when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad that I'm a man
Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors
Oh!
It's just you and I, and no other guys
We got no interruptions and we both feelin' the vibe
Say I'm not your type
But I know what's on your mind
We can talk about nothin' or we can see what it's like
Don't lie, baby, don't lie
His love never felt right
Switch sides and I'm beside you
If you say it's alright (don't lie, baby, don't lie)
Way too many heads, need a steady view
Smokin' cigarettes at the rendezvous
Never meant to cross you
But my jaw hit the floor with the one, two
Think I want you
You say this ain't love, but it's still the same love
Make love, anythin' to sate ya
Don't be shy, you decide
Say, can I make you mine?
Don't lie, baby, don't lie
His love never felt right
Switch sides and I'm beside ya
If you say it's alright
(Lemme show you how it feel like)
Don't lie, baby, don't lie
His love never felt right
Switch sides and I'm beside ya
If you say it's alright (don't lie, baby, don't lie)
your skin so fine
(Ah-ah, ah) come close, baby, put it on mine
(Ah) your skin so fine
(Ah-ah, ah) come close, baby, put it on mine
It's just you and I, and no other guys
We got no interruptions and we both feelin' the vibe
Say I'm not your type
But I know what's on your mind
We can talk about nothin' or we can see what it's like
No, oh, oh
Don't lie, baby, don't lie
His love never felt right
Switch sides and I'm beside ya
If you say it's alright
(Lemme show you what it feel like)
Don't lie, baby, don't lie
You were a phonograph, I was a kid
I sat with an ear close, just listening
I was there when the rain tapped the way down your face
You were a miracle, I was just holdin' your space
Well time has a way of throwing it all in your face
The past, she is haunted, the future is laced
Heartbreak, you know, drives a big black car
I swear I was in the back seat, just minding my own
And through the glass the corn crows come like rain
They won't stay, they won't stay for too long now
This could be all that we know of love and all
Well, you were a dancer and I was a rag
The song in my head, it was all that I had
Hope was a letter I never could send
Well, love was a country we couldn't defend
Through the carnival we watch them go round and round
All we knew of home was just a sunset and some clowns, ah-aah
Well, you were a magazine, I was a Plain Jane
Just walking the sidewalks and covered in rain
Love to just get into some of your stories
Me, all of my Plain Jane glory
Just me and all of my Plain Jane glory
Charlie Shuffler on the beat
I just wanna see you smile
I just wanna make you mine
We can spend time, smoke away the time
We can go anywhere you ever wanted
Anything you ever dreamed
I can make your dreams come true (come true)
I'll be on my own, no crew (crew)
Out here makin' these moves (yeah)
Singin' these big city blues (city, yeah)
I don't wanna think about you (nah, nah)
Every time I think about you (you)
I swear I fall in love again (damn)
I remember everything you said
Promise me it's real (yeah)
Girl, I got a deal (got a deal)
You could be my girl if I could be your world
Promise me it's real (yeah)
Girl, I got a deal (aye)
You could be my girl if I could be your world
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Coldhart, Coldhart
And we can leave this club
And we can get fucked up
In the back of the Chevy
Girl, I felt your heart beatin' heavy for me (woah)
And I just wanna see you shine (shine)
Girl, you got stars for eyes (you do)
And she sweet like Texas tea
With a ass from Tennessee
And we can take the long way home
'Cause I don't wanna see you go
Sittin' drinkin' whiskey, hopin' that you'll miss me
Baby, say you do (please say you do)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Maybe say you do
Charlie Shuffler on the beat
Da, da, da, da
The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your hometown
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby
Be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
The path that I'm walking, I must go alone
I must take the baby steps 'til I'm full-grown, full-grown
Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending, do they?
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Like a little schoolmate in the school yard
We'll play jacks and UNO cards
I'll be your best friend, and you'll be mine Valentine
Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I wanna hold yours, too
We'll be playmates and lovers and share our secret worlds
But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late, dark outside
I need to be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity, yeah
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
La, da, da, da, da, da
The big three killed my baby
No money in my hand again
The big three killed my baby
Nobody's comin' home again
Their ideas made me want to spit
A hundred dollars goes down the pit
Thirty-thousand wheels are rollin'
And my stick shift hands are swollen
Everything involved is shady
The big three killed my baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The big three killed my baby
No money in my hand again
The big three killed my baby
Nobody's comin' home again
Why don't you take the day off and try to repair?
A billion others don't seem to care
Better ideas are stuck in the mud
The motor's runnin' on trucker's blood
Don't let them tell you the future's electric
'Cause gasoline's not measured in metric
Thirty-thousand wheels are spinnin'
And oil company faces are grinnin'
Now my hands are turnin' red
And I found out my baby is dead
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The big three killed my baby
No money in my hand again
The big three killed my baby
Nobody's comin' home again
Well, I've said it now, nothing's changed
People are burnin' for pocket change
And creative minds are lazy
And the big three killed my baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And my baby's my common sense
So don't feed me planned obsolescence
Yeah, my baby's my common sense
So don't feed me planned obsolescence
I'm about to have another blowout, yeah
I'm about to have another blowout
Marigolds are very much in love, but he doesn't mind
Picking up his sister, he makes his way to see-saw land
All the way she smiles
She goes up while he goes down
Down
Sits on a stick in the river, laughter in his sleep
Sister's throwing stones, hoping for a hit
He doesn't mind, so then
She goes up while he goes down
Down
Another time (ah-ah), another day (ah-ah)
A brother's way to leave
Another time (ah-ah), another day
She'll be selling plastic flowers on a Sunday afternoon
Picking upp weeds, she hasn't got the time to care
All can see he's not there
She grows up for another man, and he's down
Another time (ah-ah), another day (ah-ah)
A brother's way to leave
Another time (ah-ah), another day
Another time (ah-ah), another day (ah-ah)
A brother's way to leave
I'm your only friend
I'm not your only friend
But I'm a little glowing friend
But really I'm not actually your friend
But I am
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
I have a secret to tell
From my electrical well
It's a simple message
And I'm leaving out the whistles and bells
So the room must listen to me
Filibuster vigilantly
My name is blue canary, one note spelled l-i-t-e
My story's infinite
Like the Longines Symphonette, it doesn't rest
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
I'm your only friend
I'm not your only friend
But I'm a little glowing friend
But really I'm not actually your friend
But I am
There's a picture opposite me
Of my primitive ancestry
Which stood on rocky shores
And kept the beaches shipwreck free
Though I respect that a lot
I'd be fired if that were my job
After killing Jason off and countless screaming Argonauts
Bluebird of friendliness
Like guardian angels, it's always near
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
And while you're at it
Keep the nightlight on inside the birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch (and while you're at it)
Who watches over you (keep the nightlight on inside the)
Make a little birdhouse in your soul (birdhouse in your soul)
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch (and while you're at it)
Who watches over you (keep the nightlight on inside the)
Make a little birdhouse in your soul (birdhouse in your soul)
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
Blackbird, fly
Blackbird, fly
Into the light of the dark black night
Blackbird, fly
Blackbird, fly
Into the light of the dark black night
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
Yo, listen up here's a story
About a little guy
That lives in a blue world
And all day and all night
And everything he sees is just blue
Like him inside and outside
Blue his house
With a blue little window
And a blue corvette
And everything is blue for him
And himself and everybody around
Cause he ain't got nobody to listen to

Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landside,
No escape from reality
Open your eyes,
Look up to the skies and see,
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
Because I'm easy come, easy go,
Little high, little low,
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to
Me, to me
Mamaaa,
Just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,
Now he's dead
Mamaaa, life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, oooh,
Didn't mean to make you cry,
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all
The time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, oooh
I don't want to die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango!
Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo, Figaro - magnificoo
I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go)(Never) Never let you go
(Let me go) (Never) let you go (Let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me,
For meee
So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows
Down among the reeds and rushes
A baby boy was found
His eyes as clear as centuries
His silky hair was brown
Never been lonely
Never been lied to
Never had to scuffle in fear
Nothing denied to
Born at the instant
The church bells chime
And the whole world whispering
Born at the right time
Me and my buddies we are travelling people
We like to go down to restaurant row
Spend those Euro-dollars
All the way from Washington to Tokyo
I see them in the airport lounge
Upon their mother's breast
They follow me with open eyes
Their uninvited guest
Never been lonely
Never been lied to
Never had to scuffle in fear
Nothing denied to
Born at the instant
The church bells chime
And the whole world whispering
Born at the right time
Too many people on the bus from the airport
Too many holes in the crust of the earth
The planet grows
Every time it registers another birth
But among the reeds and rushes
A baby girl was found
Her eyes as clear as centuries
Her silky hair was brown
Never been lonely
Never been lied to
Never had to scuffle in fear
Nothing denied to
Born at the instant
The church bells chime
And the whole world whispering
Born at the right time
Get your motor runnin'
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
In whatever comes our way
Yeah, darlin' gonna make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space
I like smoke and lightnin'
Heavy metal thunder
Racing with the wind
And the feeling that I'm under
Yeah, darlin' gonna make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space
Like a true nature's child
We were born
Born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never wanna die
Born to be wild
Born to be wild
Get your motor runnin'
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
In whatever comes our way
Yeah, darlin' gonna make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space
Like a true nature's child
We were born
Born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never wanna die
Ooh wah, ooh wah cool, cool kitty
Tell us about the boy from New York City
Ooh wah, ooh wah c'mon kitty
Tell us about the boy from New York City
He's kind of tall
He's really fine
Some day I hope to make him mine, all mine
And he's neat
And oh so sweet
And just the way he looked at me
He swept me off my feet
Ooh whee, you ought to come and see
How he walks
And how he talks
Ooh wah, ooh wah cool, cool kitty
Tell us about the boy from New York City
He's really down
And he's no clown
He has the finest penthouse I've ever seen in town
And he's cute
In his mohair suit
And he keeps his pockets full of spending loot
Ooh whee, say you ought to come and see
His dueling scar
And brand new car
Every time he says he loves me
Chills run down my spine
Every time he wants to kiss me
He makes me feel so fine
Ooh wah, ooh wah cool, cool kitty
Tell us about the boy from New York City
Well he can dance (He can dance, take a chance with a little)
And make romance (Romance baby, cause he's a looker)
That's when I feel in love
With just one glance (He's sweet talking and cool)
He was shy
And so was I
And now I know I'll never, ever say goodbye
Ooh whee, say you ought to come and see
He's the most
From coast to coast
Ooh wah, ooh wah cool, cool kitty
Tell us about the boy from New York City
Ooh wah, ooh wah c'mon kitty
Tell us about the boy from New York City
From the dark end of the street
To the bright side of the road
We'll be lovers once again
On the bright side of the road
Little darlin', come with me
Won't you help me share my load
From the dark end of the street
To the bright side of the road
Into this life we're born
Baby sometimes, sometimes we don't know why
And time seems to go by so fast
In the twinkling of an eye
Let's enjoy it while we can (let's enjoy it while we can)
Won't you help me share my load (help me share my load)
From the dark end of the street
To the bright side of the road
Into this life we're born
Baby sometimes, sometimes we don't know why
And time seems to go by so fast
In the twinkling of an eye
Let's enjoy it while we can (let's enjoy it while we can)
Help me sing my song (help me sing my song)
Little darling come alone
To the bright side of the road
On the dark end of the street (on the dark end of the street)
To the bright side of the road (to the bright side of the road)
Little darling come alone
On the bright side of the road
On the dark end of the street (on the dark end of the street)
To the bright side of the road (to the bright sight of the road)
We'll be lovers once again
On the bright side of the road
Yeah, we'll be, we'll be lovers once again
On the bright side of the road
He thought he was the King of America
Where they pour Coca Cola just like vintage wine
Now I try hard not to become hysterical
But I'm not sure if I am laughing or crying
I wish that I could push a button
And talk in the past and not the present tense
And watch this hurtin' feeling disappear
Like it was common sense
It was a fine idea at the time
Now it's a brilliant mistake
She said that she was working for the ABC News
It was as much of the alphabet as she knew how to use
Her perfume was unspeakable
It lingered in the air
Like her artificial laughter
Her mementos of affairs
"Oh" I said "I see you know him"
"Isn't that very fortunate for you"
And she showed me his calling card
He came third or fourth and there were more than one or two
He was a fine idea at the time
Now he's a brilliant mistake
He thought he was the King of America
But it was just a boulevard of broken dreams
A trick they do with mirrors and with chemicals
The words of love in whispers
And the acts of love in screams
I wish that I could push a button
And talk in the past and not the present tense
And watch this lovin' feeling disappear
Like it was common sense
I was a fine idea at the time
Now I'm a brilliant mistake
I was a fine idea at the time
Now I'm a brilliant mistake
If you ever change your mind
About leaving, leaving me behind
Baby, bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me

You know I'll always be your slave
'Til I'm buried, buried in my grave
Oh honey, bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)
One more thing
I tried to treat you right
But you stayed out, stayed out at night
But I forgive you, bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)

That's it
Was that good?
Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Oh, you know, you know
You know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searchin' for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother askin' if you look okay
You know I'll say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah
Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car, and
Four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I, I, I, I, I can't stop
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop
So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car, and
Four years, no call
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I, I, I, I, I can't stop
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop
So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
Uh huh, uh huh (yeah, Rihanna)
Uh huh, uh huh (Good Girl Gone Bad)
Uh huh, uh huh (take three, action)
Uh huh, uh huh (Hov)
No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Comin' down like Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone
We Roc-A-Fella
We fly higher than weather
In G5's or better
You know me (you know me)
In anticipation for precipitation stack chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back
With Little Ms. Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at?
You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh
These fancy things will never come in between
You're part of my entity, here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because
When the sun shines, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh
You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come into me (there's no distance in between our love)
So gon' and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because
When the sun shines, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh

Ooh, baby, it's raining, raining
You can always come into me
Come into me
It's pouring rain

Come into me
Come into me
It's pouring rain
It's pouring rain, come into me
I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say
That's what people say
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say
That's what people say
But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music in my mind
Saying it's gonna be alright
I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see
That's what they don't see
Players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break
Fakers gonna fake
I'm just gonna shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I, shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I, shake it off, I shake it off
Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm loving it
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under (toxic)
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
(Never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
(Rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
Of your hands (never had met me)
And you played it (tears are gonna fall)
To the beat (rolling in the deep)
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared
The scars of your love (never had met me)
Remind me of us (tears are gonna fall)
They keep me thinking (rolling in the deep)
That we almost had it all (you're gonna wish you)
The scars of your love (never had met me)
They leave me breathless (tears are gonna fall)
I can't help feeling (rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
(Never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
(Rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
Of your hands (never had met me)
And you played it (tears are gonna fall)
To the beat (rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating
Throw your soul through every open door (whoa)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (whoa)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (whoa)
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown
We could've had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
(Never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
(Rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
Of your hands (never had met me)
And you played it (tears are gonna fall)
To the beat (rolling in the deep)
Could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
(Never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
(Rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
Of your hands (never had met me)
But you played it, you played it, you played it
You played it to the beat
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
They tried to make me go to Rehab
But I said no, no, no
Yes I've been black, but when I come back
You'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
They tried to make me go to Rehab
But I won't go, go, go
I'd rather be at home with Ray
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing
There's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway
I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass
They tried to make me go to Rehab
But I said no, no, no
Yes I've been black, but when I come back
You'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
They tried to make me go to Rehab
But I won't go, go, go
The man said, "Why you think you here?"
I said, "I got no idea"
"I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby"
"So I always keep a bottle near"
He said, "I just think you're depressed"
"This me, yeah baby, and the rest"
They tried to make me go to Rehab
But I said no, no, no
Yes I've been black, but when I come back
You'll know, know, know
I don't ever want to drink again
I just, ooh, I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
And have everyone think I'm on the mend
And it's not just my pride
It's just 'til these tears have dried
They tried to make me go to Rehab
But I said no, no, no
Yes I've been black, but when I come back
You'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
They try to make me go to Rehab
But I won't go, go, go!
Yeah
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
(Hey, hey, hey)
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
The city's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know)
I can never say it on the phone (say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (ooh)
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
(Hey, hey, hey)
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
No one wants to stay at home
Nobody wants to be alone
When you come knocking, I'll be at your door
I don't ever wanna stop
I'm gonna give it all I've got
And when they ask me, "who could ask for more?"
Can't stand still
I won't slow down
When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
I wanna go out dancing
I wanna go out
I wanna go out, dancing
This is where I wanna be with you
Your arms wrapped around me
And fireworks reflecting in your eyes
This is how I wanna feel
The wild kiss, the music reeling
Getting down, riding all the highs
Can't stand still
I won't slow down
When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
I wanna go out dancing
I wanna go out
I wanna go out, dancing
Everybody's got a story
Let it be your blaze of glory
Burning bright, never fade away
And when the final curtain falls, we could say we did it all
The never ending of a perfect day
Can't stand still (Can't stand still)
I won't slow down (Won't slow down)
When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
I wanna go out dancing
I wanna go out
I wanna go out
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You and I go hard
At each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough
We keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get so damn dysfunctional we stop keeping score
You and I get sick
Yeah, I know that we can't do this no more, yeah
But baby, there you go again, there you go again making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know, I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night
Try to tell you, "No"
But my body keeps on telling you, "Yes"
Try to tell you, "Stop"
But your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up
In the morning probably hating myself
And I'll be waking up
Feeling satisfied, but guilty as hell, yeah
But baby there you go again, there you go again making me love you
(Making me you love you)
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go (let it all go)
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
(Like a tattoo, yeah)
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you (ah)
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die (yeah)
That I'll only stay with you one more night (oh-oh-oh)
And I know, I've said it a million times (yeah)
But I'll only stay with you one more night (yeah)
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, baby, give me one more night
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, baby, give me one more night
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, yeah
Yeah, baby, give me one more night
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah
But baby there you go again, there you go again making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head, let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die (oh-oh, oh-oh)
That I'll only stay with you one more night (oh, oh-oh oh)
And I know I've said it a million times (oh, I've said it a million times)
But I'll only stay with you one more night
(Yeah, baby, give me one more night)
So I cross my heart and I hope to die (yeah, yeah)
That I'll only stay with you one more night (yeah, yeah)
And I know, I've said it a million times (yeah, yeah)
But I'll only stay with you one more night (yeah, yeah)
State of emergency
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!
Remember the time, baby?
Yeah! Yeah!
I ain't got no money
I ain't got no car to take you on a date
I can't even buy you flowers
But together we could be the perfect soulmates
Talk to me girl
Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go Dutch, you can still touch my love, it's free
We can work without the perks just you and me
Thug it out 'til we get it right

'Cause I like you just the way you are

Talk to me girl

Baby if you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are

Boy I like you just the way you are
And let me see ya strip, you can get a tip

Boy I like you just the way you are
And let me see ya strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like, I like, I like
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself 'cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way, to never let it get that far
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side, so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh
Every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side, so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I watched you die (I watched you die)
I heard you cry
Every night in your sleep
I was so young (and you're so young)
You should have known better (I was too young for you)
Than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain (you never saw me)
And now I cry
In the middle of the night
For the same damn thing
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh, girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well, I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care, I don't, but
You still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on, but now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care, I don't, but
You still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on, but now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself (yeah)
And if you think (you think) that I'm (that I'm)
Still holdin' on to somethin' (holdin' on, no)
You should go and love yourself
It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Crashing, hit a wall
Right now I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reaching out
I call your name, but you're not around
I say your name, but you're not around
I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down
Running out of time
I really thought you were on my side
But now there's nobody by my side
I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, don't let me down, down, down
Ooh, I think I'm losing my mind now, yeah
Ooh, I think I'm losing my mind now, yeah
I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
Don't let me down
Yeah, don't let me down
Yeah, don't let me down
Don't let me down, oh, no
Said don't let me down
I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead (gonna wind up dead)
Needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head (gotta get you outta my head)
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead (wind up dead)
Needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head, get you outta my head
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees (falling on my knees)
And now that I'm without your kisses (without you)
I'll be needing stitches (and I'll be needing stitches)
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help (begging baby, please)
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Dance with me under the diamonds
See me like breath in the cold
Sleep with me here in the silence
Come kiss me, silver and gold
You say that I won't lose you
But you can't predict the future
So, just hold on like you will never let go
Yeah, if you ever move on without me
I need to make sure you know that
You are the only one I'll ever love
(I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone
(I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Looking back on my life
You're the only good I've ever done (ever done)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone (anyone)
Not anyone
Forever's not enough time to (oh)
Love you the way that I want (love you the way that I want)
'Cause every morning I find you (oh)
I fear the day that I don't
You say that I won't lose you
But you can't predict the future
'Cause certain things are out of our control
Yeah, if you ever move on without me
I need to make sure you know that
You are the only one I'll ever love
Only one (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Yeah, you, if it's not you it's not anyone
(I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Looking back on my life
You're the only good I've ever done (I've ever done)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone
It's not anyone, not anyone
Oh, oh, oh, oh
If it's not you, it's not anyone
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, whoa
Yeah, you are the only one I'll ever love
(I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone
(I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya) gotta tell ya
Looking back on my life
You're the only good I've ever done (ever done, oh, yeah)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone
Stop the clocks, it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances off your head
A million colours of hazel, golden and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again
We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing, Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I
We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Tastes like strawberries
On a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want more berries
And that summer feelin'
It's so wonderful and warm
Breathe me in
Breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without
I'm just thinking out loud
I don't know if I could ever go without
Watermelon sugar
High
Watermelon sugar
High
Watermelon sugar
High
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar
Strawberries
On a summer evenin'
Baby, you're the end of June
I want your belly
And that summer feelin'
Getting washed away in you
Breathe me in
Breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without
Watermelon sugar
High
Watermelon sugar
High
Watermelon sugar
High
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar
High
Watermelon sugar
High
Watermelon sugar
High
Watermelon sugar high
I just wanna taste it
I just wanna taste it
Watermelon sugar high
Tastes like strawberries
On a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want your belly
And that summer feelin'
I don't know if I could ever go without
Watermelon sugar
High
Watermelon sugar
High
Watermelon sugar (sugar)

Watermelon sugar high (sugar)
Watermelon sugar

Watermelon sugar

Watermelon sugar high
I just wanna taste it
I just wanna taste it
Watermelon sugar high
I just wanna taste it
I just wanna taste it
Watermelon sugar high

Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anything, when will I learn?
I push it down, I push it down
I'm the one for a "good time call"
Phone's blowin' up, ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love, feel the love
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
Throw 'em back 'til I lose count
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
Feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier
But I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight
Sun is up, I'm a mess
Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame (ah)
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
Throw 'em back 'til I lose count
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
Feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier
But I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight, on for tonight
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight, on for tonight
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight, on for tonight
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are, oh
So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby, we found love right where we are (maybe)
And we found love right where we are
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for you
My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh
Give me all of you, oh
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you
I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh
