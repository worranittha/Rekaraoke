well show me the way
'cause nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'
she said look, what's your game baby
savage love, did somebody, did somebody break your heart
told you i'll be here forever
oh baby, we found love right where we are maybe
all i know is we said, "hello"
another saturday night and i ain't got nobody
if your schemes like your dreams
you fell, i caught you
i'm on my way now
gee i'd like to see you looking swell
god, give us the reason
ooh, oh
i know she gon' be ready when i slide through
remember that with every piece of
just because i know i'll never ever feel the same
the payback is all the reason that i'm flexing
the whole world stops and stares for a while
come on babe, why don't we paint the town?
watch how my wons and yens, and dollars be droppin' on you, you, you
rock on with your bad self.
i'll carry these torches for ya
i look around and
'cause without you babe
put words together like letter, man
some just want everything
i'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
just who i was born to be
one red flag and i'm gone already onto
it's gonna drive you to ruin
i can't lie, i blame you for everything
when i'm in your firm embrace
that's so us that's so us
i don't waste my time trying to get what you got
but i'll never know by living
cause i'm all grown up and i'm black and blue
and then she asks me do you feel alright
but i can’t
and i wanna take you with me
you could pick the time and the place
holdin' me back
perfect don't mean that it's working
and all my friends, they tell me they see
and sit tight while i start reviewin'
and rain fell through the night
you still hit my phone up
and i'm sorry that i couldn't get to you
with their hand froze to the reins
and tenement halls
i'm living someone else's life
drown inside my vices all day
as the world keeps spinning round
it's a simple message
long distance, i need you
with your heart in weathered hands
born at the right time
don't care what you do you
i love it, i hate it, and i can't take it
heaven-sent gentleman
third of december
'cause everything's so wrong and i don't belong
when i say you're not the best i've ever had
'cause i don't fall for boys like you i don't fall for
and the memories bring back, memories bring back you
if i made you feel, oh, second best you did, you did
i'm just gon' sit here laid back to this nice mellow beat, you know
she had ruby red lips, coal black hair
limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
so deep until it's all we got
and i'll sing it
and when we get behind closed doors
now ever since my debut, i've continued to lay you.
cause you know i can't do it on my own
and you let it burn
i talk that talk runways i walk walk
i feel like i could fly with the boy on the moon
we make peppermint tea
but a far-off gaze is wide in me
and if we had babies they would look like you
and a quack quack there.
'cause lately i've been losing sleep
this is the anthem
that make me who i am
when autumn leaves start to fall
we met in the springtime when blossoms unfold
and he's neat
'cause there's a spark in you
trying to light up the dark?
turning up at my door
the bitches wanna cope
i wish
filibuster vigilantly
telling lies
with my mind messed up
listen, i don't slack a bit
i wanna know i wanna know
just let you leave without a trace
some people think
but i can't make them stay
til we had nothing left
but it brings to mind another time
always look on the bright side of life
'cause everything's so wrong, and i don't belong
and it's almost and it's almost independence day
check, check, check
you will see, what you mean to me
so don't wake me up finally able to breathe, yeah, yeah, yeah
i'm up in heaven
oh my god do i pray
after fighting through my tears and finally you put me first
i'll be the one if you want me to
you'd change so quick, you'd start a fight then you'd be saying sorry
'cause i can see the sun light up the sky
and i swear, i swear it's not a lie, girl
close my eyes, can't think of anything but us
all of the people i've ghosted stand there in the room
do you know that there's still a chance for you?
and murmured vague obscenities
but are we all lost stars
oh, don't you know that i wait
oh yeah!
to a new home in the sun
will eventually be a memory of a time when
and my baby's my common sense
and i'll write your name
then i'd rather have nothing at all
and make you understand, amanda
left its seeds while i was sleeping
sunday morning rain is falling
now don't you wait or hesitate
jay, rain man is back
the beautiful kind, makin' up for lost time
i needed to lose you to find me
don't let me down, down, down
feeling satisfied, but guilty as hell, yeah
oh, they're beauty marks, beauty marks
now we're in baltimore,
and then i tell her as i turn out the light
every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
do you love it when you keep me guessin' me guessin'
we got plans to make
of our own device"
i want this dream to be real
or too tired to say, "i want you"
if you say, "i'm always yours"
you must think that i'm stupid
oh some would
when i go out, i wanna go out dancing
oh, you're gonna see your sheba shimmy-shake
like you already know you're never saying goodbye
you don't give a damn about me
i still feel alone
true love true love
and she's all i wanna be
oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
won't you come and go with me
and 'tis love, and love alone, that can repay!
don't care what you do you, oh, you
turned away from me, sadly as i see
i would never fall in love again, until i found her
when it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
plenty of room at the hotel california
for you i'd bleed myself dry
i swear i meant to mean the best when it ended
maybe i didn't love you
hoping i'll find
you would know that you are
i wish that i could kiss you while you knit
my mama don't like you and she likes everyone
and all my walls
you see me
lucky, lucky girl ooh
loving can heal loving can mend your soul
girl, i felt so alone inside of this crowded room
oh, no, no, i just keep on coming back to you back to you
now that it's raining more than ever
londie it could have not been done
when i felt all of the hatred
hmm and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
how i wish i had some chick to talk to
cause i put a smile on my face
boy, nothin' in life is free
we were staying in paris
and high school girls with clear-skinned smiles
oh, oh, baby.
you played it to the beat
but i've heard one on you, now i'm gonna make your head burn
and i got no pride
but i wanna go home
i'm itchin' like a man on a fuzzy tree
to the bright side of the road to the bright side of the road
you walk into the room with your pencil in your hand
but ooh, this time i'm telling you, i'm telling you
how many last songs are left
you are the angel glow that lights a star,
sometimes i give myself the creeps
all you gotta do is plug me into high
way down south in new orleans
don't want to go by satan
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
people are burnin' for pocket change
oh you're the best part, oh
so, just hold on like you will never let go
oh, baby, where are you now when i need you most?
well, please, don't ask me what's upon my mind
i wanna touch your heart
all i do is dream of you
hey, i'm talking to ya we got things to do
stolen kisses pretty lies
old but i'm not that old
see how i'll leave with every piece of you
to all the lovely ladies in their finery tonight
you can always come into me
hello, darkness, my old friend
peculiar as can be
i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
i hear that's it's cold way down there
when you close your eyes
i do, i do, i do
and get drunken off your tears
you can't see shiny cars
yeah, i need to tell you something
tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
but you'll come back each time you leave
any time of year any time of year
baby what you doin', where you at, where you at?
swear there ain't no heaven
i never, never, never
aw, yeah-yeah-yeah
yeah, i stopped using my head, using my head, let it all go
when you say you love me, that make me crazy
hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
and an oink oink here.
frightened of this thing that i've become
but in the corner of my mind corner of my mind
i care for you
the feeling takes so long to grow
you try so hard but you don't understand
it
and i just wanna tell you i am
and find me again
if you don't know my crew by now then,
yours yours until the mountain crumbles to the sea
we got no interruptions and we both feelin' the vibe
i know nothing at all
girl i like you, i do i do
i think of all the friends i've known
but i'm a little glowing friend
you can run into my arms
they never parted,
melodramatic fools
i figured out all the clues
you and i get sick
we ain't ever getting older
your love stays with me day and night
happy endings
so umm, let me loosen up my bra strap.
and you'll miss the bestest pal you ever had
here comes the devil, right behind
her nice big house
just once try to wrap your little brain around my feelings
but how'd we get in this position
i saw the signs and i ignored it
you look so proud standing there with a frown and a cigarette
grab your passport and my hand
there were voices down the corridor
it's way too soon, i know this isn't love
there's nothing you can do that can't be done
stars, bulbs, baby
but we gon' be alright
spare him his life from this monstrosity
oh baby believe me it's only a matter of time, time
i like you, i do
but i feel like i die 'til i feel your touch
oh, i remember you driving to my house
it's you, babe
he's sat back while she's droppin' it
eating sugar
makes no difference what you say
you can raise your voice, but know that you have no choice
what you want you, a house? you, a car?
and i had a serious dream
while he was handlin' this risky chore
tell us about the boy from new york city
if you should find you miss the sweet and tender love we used to share
'cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen
oh yes, i guess suggest the rest should fess
when i want you and all your charms
they can only guess
no doubt about it
ride with me jesus, help me pull this heavy load
never had to scuffle in fear
you're the one i love
hmm, we keep this love in a photograph
every time we say goodbye
but each time i try i just break down and cry
i'm somebody you call when you're alone
lucky to have been where i have been
since i first met you baby, i never knew what i was missing
no, i'd rather, rather have nothing at all
my granny told me that when i was only a youth
rather
and now my
we met by chance and i knew at a glance
sniffin' beans and smokin' dope
'cause you know in your heart, babe
another kiss is what it takes
and we don't talk but he sings along like
but now i've gone and thrown it all away
to sound like me, so soon i'll have to open
but something is happening and you don't know what it is
the church bells chime
sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing
no matter what the distance between
it's pouring rain, come into me
i don't mind, 'cause you mean that much to me
because
happened so naturally
i would do it all again
you and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
and now i'm all fucked up and my heart's changed
who made the spikey urchin?
for her poor old henna'd curls
ooh, uh huh
i'm not content to be with you in the day time
under the open sky, oh my, baby i'm trying
and let it shine
the leaves are buried under six inches of white
stranded, reaching out
yeah, one-nine-nine-four.
we, ooh, getting back together, ohhh
get out of my
you've forgotten about
while we break your spine
give me all of you, oh
uh huh, uh huh take three, action
so, baby, pull me closer
now that's dictation, proceeding to my innovation
as we're both getting old
set a course for brighter days
i ain't got seventy days
what are we fighting for
cause you got tired of my scheming
it's a curse
i'll fall in love with the little things
do you feel me now?
ringin' the bell
jonah in the whale, noah in the ark
you're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head i blame
when i feel blue in the night
just like i told you before, before
wanted me to push her broom
i'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
do you really want to see me crawl
now you're textin' all my friends asking questions
i should be livin' my life so i go to heaven and never come back
in the sun, i feel as one
i was a workshop owner
love knew me
come on i'll say it slowly romance!
alison, i know this world is killing you.
on the dark end of the street on the dark end of the street
are we meant to take more than we give?
for meee
and texas is a place i'd dearly love to be
you said you just needed space and so i gave it
oh, woman, woman, i know, i know
of our own device
but she wears short skirts
from the constant hell i'd put him through
listen while i say
living and forgiving and
when you're 25
i could show you incredible things
i know flowers go through rain
nothing in the world could drive me away
'cause you've got a soul
modern loneliness, we're never alone
don't mess it up, talking that shit
make a little birdhouse in your soul
i was there when the rain tapped the way down your face
and darling i will be loving you 'til we're 70
oh, i will hold on to the afterglow
oh honey, bring it to me
mmm hmm baby face
no, i don't give a damn
and we can leave this club
cause i'm afraid that living couldn't get any better
can't wake me up nothing can wake me up
fit for one who sits and cries
and all that music, lord, if you just listen'
once again
you don't know babe
"oh" i said "i see you know him"
love gives you the right to be free
we'll take this way too far ooh
so tell
but i hate you, i really hate you
in the morning night-time too
making my way downtown
all i know is we said hello
do you think time would pass us by?
hold up the peace sign, assalam walaikum
of rags and silks, a costume
baby, say you do please say you do
i know that you want little ole me
cause i'm 'bout to pull his girl like a hammy, hammy wow
headed for st. pierre
they left their
saturday morning is fading
like cashew, don't you know that i will mash you? for real,
that jazz
that was the day we ran into albert flasher
suddenly, i'm a fiend and you're all i need
y tú no ve' que lo hago porque te amo
when you're out of sight
and a sad refrain
all things rude and nasty,
but the day i stopped my search
fairytales are not the truth
i bless the rains down in africa
repenting other lives unknown
oh, if you bring it to me
a million people i
i drew a line for you
did not know it was love
80 in the benz when that roof go back
i guess peter pan was right
i won't slow down
does he laugh the way i did
they call me on and on across the universe
oh, beauty marks
and i'm a monster on the hill
should be in your arms but i'm begging at your feet
well, i ask you very confidentially
and now i know i'll never, ever say goodbye
cause i know i'm addicted to your drama
baby, baby, baby, baby, baby sweet darling'
all i do the whole day through is dream of you, oh ?
there were children crying and colors flying
dirt, dirt, dirt
you're the only man i see
and leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
i tilted your cloud
and begging down upon his bended knee
then some returned,
dated a girl that i hate for the attention
'cause i want you baby
only want to go naturally
i didn't wanna self destruct, the evils of lucy was all around me
dollar, dollars dropping on my ass tonight
but in the end
make me walk, make me talk, do whatever you please
no clouds in my stones
i got nine lives
we are never ever ever getting back together
out of my mind, out of my mind
yes, i'm back
are my expectations far too high?
say it's all right
got nothing in my brain
in the spring of
rose garden filled with thorns
don't tell me it's not worth trying for
want you back, want you back, want you back for good
i am the roughest, roughest, roughest. say what? say what? say what?
made you put down your guard
my heart beats, so it scares me to death
and i just can't wait to be home
i know i'm weaker than i probably seem
yahoo girl no dey for here
tell me he savors your glory
things have gotten worse
we can spend time, smoke away the time
all day and all of the night time
if i ain't got you with me, baby
remember how that lasted for a day
frozen i held my breath
now it's a brilliant mistake
baby baby i can hear the wind whipping past my face
please don't leave me girl don't you go
i ain't jokin', woman, i've got to ramble
and your eyes look like
rehearse and repeat it, 'cause i
but baby, think what you're doin'
but i can’t, no i can’t, no i can’t
and it went just like this
and i... will stumble and fall
no looking back to the past
another time ah-ah, another day
oh, i won't be silent and i won't let go
some of us got to live as well, you know
i know this love is real
i know you'll go and change your mind
i'm still tryna learn it by heart
well i never want to leave
i don't talk about it, be about it, everyday i see cool
it's so unreal
and i, i am feeling a little peculiar
andi'm talkin' 'bout you and i
let the music play on play on, play on, play on...
staring blankly ahead just making my way
oh, o, o, o, yes
when your legs don't work like they used to before
morning, noon and night-time, too
double up or quit
that love was meant for beauty queens
i, i, i, shake it off, i shake it off
we don't know how to come down
see i pick my friends like i pick my fruit
baby was a workshop owner
i don't need to be forgiven for loving you so much
lucky, lucky girl uh
we've seen each other naked seen each other cry
he held the door held my hand in the dark
someone said it drowns a memory
if there's some left for you
do you hear me?
why, why, why, why, why why
is green eyes and freckles and your smile
you're still in love with me but your friends don't know
the rent's unpaid, dear
and if you think you think that i'm that i'm
take my hand, stop, put van the man on the jukebox
she gon' do all it for me when them bands come
and i would gladly hit the road, get up and go if i knew
i moved away and changed my number when i did it
i can swear there ain't no heaven
it must be true love
twerking, twerking, when i buy the things i like
you can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
the devil fools with the best laid plan
give me some milk or else go home"
and i was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on
you kept everything inside
now who wants action satisfaction
even if we owe the grocer
he always call me 'cause i never cause no drama
to the beat rolling in the deep
'cos we've shared the laughter and the pain and even shared the tears
'til i'm buried, buried in my grave
tonight i'm getting over you.
no one dared
or were we too afraid
whenever i'm wrong, just tell me the song whenever i'm wrong, i'll tell you
come on along, come on along
i had to stop for the night
life is for us to keep
go find a girl who wants to listen
to get me through
and it's not just my pride
but we're only wastin' time if your pockets are empty
i'm living someone
oh, alison, my aim is true.
oh yeah
oh, let me hold you
drinking from plastic cups
oh, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah
i'll run my hands through your hair
warm smell of colitas
and i can make all your demons be gone
we push and pull like a magnet do
and when i die and when i'm dead, dead and gone
a baby girl was found
there's a picture opposite me
so pull up your stakes, children,
ain't we got fun?
hey, what you doing with a girl like that?
wait for me to come home
ain't no half steppin'
oh, you lured me in, i couldn't sense the pain
for a destination, mmm
and they been around
and we're a part of it, don't act so confused
business men, they drink my wine
please say to me please, just say to me
or sit silently
hurry boy, she's waiting there for you
maybe i didn't treat you
it is the only thing
or if i should be leaving
all you need is love all together now
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
i wake up screaming from dreaming
each little wasp that stings,
i go on too many dates
i'm feelin' like i've missed you all this time
ah your skin so fine
what's it all about when you sort it out, alfie?
you're to blame
the planet grows
and then end up crying
it's hard on a fella, when he don't know his way around
light it up, light it up, so explosive
field o' cotton, tell me where i am,
i'm not your only friend
funny you come back to me, my dear
coldhart, coldhart
how much i love you.
smokin' cigarettes at the rendezvous
boy, i don't give a fuck
well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
do do doop do doop da dum
liable to walk upon the scene
and let me see ya strip, you can get a tip
and when i walked
but things just get so crazy living
you're the king baby i'm your queen
cause in bass and treble we trust
and he's perfect on paper but he's lying to my face
give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
and by the spring of eighteen-sixty
just because i never took your picture off my phone
when i never felt so lost
well some
as they tried to cross the plains.
everywhere an oink oink.
but you believe the things that i do
the friday night charades of youth
well time has a way of throwing it all in your face
where we sang
save me, save me
my story's infinite
come on, barbie, let's go party ooh oh, ooh oh
and i i am feeling a little peculiar
back
double stake or split
but watching you stand alone
you got to spread joy up to the maximum
you can turn me on with just a touch, baby
i've learned the hard way, to never let it get that far
come on now
can you handle me the way i are?
it was a fine idea at the time
just because i accidentally slipped and said your name
and kiss me slowly
or an animation, a cartoon to me
but i forgive you, bring it to me
she rocks rough and stuff with the afro puffs.
i feel your love and i feel it burn
and you can tell me if i'm off
i'm different, so don't compare me to another
lonely
the world is beating you down, i'm around through every mood
yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone anyone
they'll tell you what's theirs and what's yours
am i just paranoid
you're original, cannot be replaced
no one else can break my heart like you
cause i'm-a break it down to the nitty-gritty one time.
'cause my heart belongs to you
and i offered myself to the world
inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
i wear t-shirts
i don't really give a care
you're gonna feel blue, and you're gonna feel sad
i think it's time, think it's time that you show it
and all the rest imprisoned by mistake
don't want to go by the demon
another kiss is all you need
bring your alibis
what it meant to me
nothing denied to
i'm gonna leave you, go away
maybe you should know that
like a true nature's child
they'll do it every time
and i've been trying hard against unbelievable odds
so tell me that it's time for me to go
don't tell me it's not worth fighting for
the hour's getting late, hey
is this a part of your story
keep you second guessing like
yeah fingers trace your every outline oh yeah yeah
i was lost within the darkness, but then i found her
and i was thinking to myself
then you come around again and say
here's what i'll offer you
did you get your middle name from your grandma
to a cat named frankenstein
i will not make the same mistakes that you did
i got new, i got new, i...
we gon' be alright
haven't i made it clear i made it very clear
you can find it here
i love you for a thousand more
we would meet on the very first page
there ain't no cure,
that i'd rather be
girl, i got a deal aye
they're all blues!
sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
and kinda pat your feet
are written on the subway walls
you hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek
i get drunk on jealousy
aw, i need something "you proof"
as long as you love me
all that talk you need to save that
oh woah yeah yeah yeah
and he may go to hell or even vancouver
please don't see
we'll be playmates and lovers and share our secret worlds
he said, "i just think you're depressed"
from our history books we all learned
rudeboy doomshop, mothafucker
figured what the fuck i want to do in life and practiced it
i remember that old frio river
blue are the words i say
you're still the girl in the club
i long to hold you tight
always late with your kisses
bring the beat in
well i say you love me too.
that maybe we found love right where we are
then straight on to the morning
at first you put your arms around me
and i still miss you
we can talk about nothin' or we can see what it's like
hear him whip the women just around midnight
like a stab in the back
i would charge in and rescue you
and soon i'll hear old winter's song
i'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
it's no good unless he needs you, all the way
when my depression works the graveyard shift
we're going out on our first date
la di da di da
but i miss you most of all my darling
my eyes are caught in your gaze all over again
the only thing you see
you decorate a tree
oh yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
she said love, lord above
when she touched my hand, what a chill i got
stay secure that's all i'm asking from you
and i thought i saw you out there crying
in the words that it was forming
and i need you to know that we're falling so fast
although my heart is falling too
and hope this night will last forever
say i wouldn't care if you walked away
the man said, "why you think you here?"
acting like i was part of your property
gimme a break give me a break
and have faith, or pandemonium
into this life we're born
but you can never leave
there'll be one child born
strawberries
i'll keep dancing till the morning with somebody new
they gathered for the feast
boy, i hear you in my dreams
my mistake, i didn't know to be in love
'cause you've got a soul and everybody knows
and you deserve more than that
and disappointing you is gettin' me down
the name is big daddy, you know, as in your father
he's got a hold on me
and i’m wildin’, stylin’ on them
throw 'em back 'til i lose count
hey, hey baby,
or am i just stoned?
into the light of the dark black night
maybe i'm thinking maybe
hope you are quite prepared to die
here's your perfect
you're on the phone with your girlfriend
i knew that i'd found a home for my heart
toast to the ones that we lost on the way
don't i wish they were carryin' me
heaven can be yours just for now
40 acres and a mule? a piano, a guitar?
let it rain, i hydroplane in the bank
now he got me on a leash 'cause he said no strings
if i decide if you're invited i wish i knew you wanted me
not much money, oh, but honey

years ago, my heart was set to live, oh
but i know it's gonna take the real work oh-oh

didn't think you could change this fast
and i know the roads to riches
but these days i don't even know myself, no

this dancing was killing me softly
you're the one that always calls
frighten you or uptighten you
watermelon sugar high sugar
i would give it all, i would sacrifice
i answer too fast
saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
a billion others don't seem to care
and some would curse john
when you wake up early in the
jai guru deva
and loves so distant and obscure
takin' flight, makin' me feel like
'cause people like to talk
the
i believe some hearts will survive
making one as lovely as she
walk the wire for you, yeah, i'd die for you
but no one's ever left me quite this sore
so i make friends with my shadow
i just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
i dreamed i held you in my arms.
oh let me go home
born to be wild
you all the best
let's go get it, oh, oh
what's going wrong?
sometimes i wish that i could stop you from talking
all the young dudes hey, you there, with the glasses!
high voltage, high voltage
fast forward to eighteen
hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
what's in ya' dome
with a taste of a poison paradise
you're toxic, i'm slippin' under toxic
if any child of mine gets out a line boastin'
life is aisha
i don't ever wanna stop
some hungry cats at the gate
if it's 10,000 hours or the rest of my life
and baby was a workshop owner
da da, ooooh
if someone could relieve you of your chains
left you with assumption
i'll be waking up
and i'm not scared to say those
quick to improvise
simplify you, classify you
so you see, i have got to say no, no
you got those pretty eyes in your head, you know it
i can feel the sun whenever you're near
brighter than a
all you need is love
now we're arguin' in my bedroom
help me, i'm holding on for dear life
you're the one that i can't deny
you good to go
don't forget you're the one that tried to get with my friends
as long as i'm with you
i love everything about you, you're imperfectly perfect
can you feel it
and what costume shall the poor girl wear
please don't go breaking my heart
the radio is playing, iron & wine
remember those who win the game
but something is happening here and you don't know what it is
i see your lips, the summer kisses
baby, come into me
broke down along the coast oh
i've put my trust in you
don't want to die uneasy
i just wanna hate you
cause if you fell
like the fourth of july
i tell myself i don't care that much
almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home
burning bright, never fade away
and by then i'll just be someone
how can i just let you walk away?
'cause this house is not a home
dream, dream, dream, dream
and my stick shift hands are swollen
one more thing
they only get what they deserve"
where are you where are you
they're jamming in the street all night
who dread the thought of going 'round the bend
oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
tell me why are we
'til the creeks was whipped and peace was in store
but the timing's off
oh, some would fail and some would prosper
is just a memory
mummy don't know daddy's getting hot
'cause tonight is the night that i'm feeling alright
is it just for the moment we live?
by myself
i'm the one who makes you laugh
something in my mind wanna talk 'bout it
i tried so hard
i said high, i said high
oh, i can hear it callin' me
of just dreaming i dream a little dream you, yu-yu-yu, yu-yu-yu, yu-yu-yu
come on, show 'em what you're worth
hey-ey, yeah yeah yeah
but you never wanna be each others'
jumped in my car tried to clear my mind
and i've got an aching head
as it was, as it was
you belong with me?
what you, ooh, uh, what'd you do
whoa oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
i've never felt so happy
how all the pain that you inflicted made me feel so little
all the love i miss loving,
people talking without speaking
all the handsome gentlemen with loving on their minds
this emptiness won't let me live without you
right from the start
another
if i tell you today, will you turn me away
we could waste the night with an old
let it all go
i'm in the room it's a typical tuesday night
only by dying will tell
i will not stand in your way
i hoped that cutting you off would make me feel different
the whole night through
i don't even care
i learned the truth at seventeen
clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
you know it's true
and the lambs are on the run
what hurt the most
smoke then i know
through the pain through the fads
i never thought through love we'd be
'cause we're young, and we're reckless
analyze you, categorize you
come on baby it's you
and you know something's happening but you don't know what it is
you know i'm born to lose
sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all
i can hear, hear them echoing
this must be love, am not searching anymore
oh darlin' cause you'll always be my baby
ah-ah, ah come close, baby, put it on mine
pay attention, none of this is happening by accident
to all the little dreamers with a dream that cannot last
'cause you're the one who said that you were in love
you see the signs, but you can't read
and latch on to the affirmative
another day, knowin' i love you
i say, "i hate you," we break up, you call me, "i love you."
motherfucker, you can live at the mall
and the big three killed my baby
counting the tattoos on your skin
and all i feel
and everything's over
cuz we got bodies on bodies
they livin' it up at the hotel california
oh, jambali
take a good look at me now, 'cos i'll still be standin' here
rage in effect so you know how it is.
when skies are grey, when skies are blue
there's nowhere, unless you're there
the end the end the end the end
seems like we do it just for fun
it's cold way down there
you're crazy and i'm out of my mind
what a drag
ooh, and i wish you wouldn't wait for me but you always do
and i know the night is fading
watch the time go right out the window
state of emergency
do you hear me, do you feel me? we gon' be alright
nobody offered his word
i fear the day that i don't
and then the railroad came behind them
i know that
you knew i could not resist
needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head, get you outta my head
you'll be mine and i'll be yours
all night long! all night
finally you put my love on top
please don't tell
it is the only thing makes us feel alive
a couple of things i can't spell without 'u'
steal you roses every day
man if i was back home i'd be swinging
i never stray too far from the sidewalk
i said, "i got no idea"
make you plead and cry as you give up all the lies
the rich get rich and the poor get poorer
your time is up, i'll tell you why
can't stop, won't stop moving
i'll love you for a thousand more
cause i didn't want anyone thinking i still care
and if you hurt me
when everything was going right
this is our life
say something...
the burning hopes, the joy and idle tears that fall!
me and my friends at the table doing
i should have bit my tongue while we were still ahead
up and down the, up and down the, up and down the san francisco bay
you'd think i'd had enough
well, i'm back in black
look how they shine
and you're looking so cool
yeah, don't let me down
a parayer is prayed
just like your shadow
and it's so, it's so
makes me happy ain't nobody, baby
cause you're my iron man
nobody's comin' home again
isn't she lovely
i won't lie to you
some dance to remember
i know your eyes in the morning sun
"i'm gonna, i'm gonna lose my baby"
with the one two three four five
mmmmm, mmmmm
cast in a golden light
i just wanna see you smile
but i've got a blank space, baby
i got so much love to give you babe
i'll be
he was a fine idea at the time
you ask me why i like to dance
and explode into space
baby, 'cause you're the one that i love
'cause we're young and we're reckless oh
barefoot servants, too
deeper than the deep blue sea is
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
you belong with me
scarred old slaver know he's doin' alright
well, look her over once or twice
they don't know how long it takes
why silks and linens of yesterday's gowns
"isn't that very fortunate for you"
you know i'll say
and while you're at it
find a flask, we're playin' fast and loose
just give yourself a break or someone else will take
i'm here right now, right now
everybody's not the real mccoy
all you need is love, love
let me come inside
if you only knew what the future holds
it's like i just
than the summer of two thousand and two
we were only eleven
every time that i say i'm gonna walk away
i guess i should take it as a sign
they own about half the state
now you want to be free
that justice was due every redskin band
i've never felt so alive and free
your eyes like a spotlight
i ain't got the time
you see somebody naked and you say, "who is that man?"
just like a lady should be
oh my god look at that face
a façade you can never face
and all day and all night
you got me dancing in my bed, so let me show it
thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me
over all my best friends
i bring the pain like
and i'll give you love
inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
it’s a pain in my chest i just wanna see you again
friends can break your heart too, and
oh me i fall in love with you every single day
i'm in your car again
like she's the only girl you've ever seen
boof, what i'm smokin on
i'm a fool
and if i'll be honest with you now
you'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had
if i ain't got you yeah
after you've gone there's no denyin'
to shine with you, with you, with you
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down
i know you got to see me
all the young dudes i want to hear you!
so i think i'll fly away
your silky words are sweet
where are you
and write a power chord and if the place be plush
cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
da ba dee da ba di
and the people bowed and prayed
just take my hand
i wanna share babies
the roses have faded, there's frost at my door
my money moves
you can buy a woman clothes
don't lie, baby, don't lie
you pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown
now tell my mama i love her but this what i like
and even now, baby, i'm still not okay
cross hearts i'vе been the one to ride
help me sing my song help me sing my song
didn't think you would hurt this bad
so hey let's be friends
picked up the dope
i celebrated glory
and fireworks reflecting in your eyes
all i want is love that lasts
i tell you, i'm your man
did you even care when i was gone
through the good or lean years
won't you give yourself to me
i got these feelings but you never mind that shit
now i've drunk a lot of wine, and i'm feeling fine
and the rich-relationed hometown queen
whoa it's all right
but when you're not there i just crumble
i was runnin' away from facin' reality, uh
the clock ticks life away
up and down the, up and down the san francisco bay
yesterday love is all you need
you're the best kind of bad something
boy don't you know you can't escape me, yeah
open your eyes,
well, you must be going crazy thinking i'll be back, i'm sorry
it's in the air and it's all around
when you're leaving then you leave me stressin' me stressin'
i'm flawed by design and you loved to remind me
oh my god who is she
and i know that one day, baby, it's really gonna grow, yes, it is
mmm, i got to go home
but acting like grownups
time is a valuable thing
stay away too long and i can't do without you
all along the watchtower
do me dirt, dirt, dirt
cause we're living in a world of fools
time stands still
he won't take you away
only trouble is, gee whiz
difference is now if finally found a way to manage it
but i will take my chances
i still remember
when the clouds come, we gone
watch it count down to the end of the day
after you've gone, after you've gone away.
let's take a lil' dip, lil' lady
it's dangerous, i'm falling
i wanna wrap my hands around your neck
what a weasel, oh no
and why, why, why, why, why
i know just where to find the answers
and you ask me why i'm in a band
i'm about to have another blowout, yeah
come on now, follow my lead
goin' through the jungle
they'd be spent in sweet content just dreamin' away
right up here is where i store the juice
'cause i can't please you, and that's why i do what i do
it's just another sad love song
less than one minute old
oh, you look good to me
"what's going on?"
see me like breath in the cold
oh, listen to me children and-a you will hear
all by myself
keep me warm in your love then you softly leave
we been hurt, been down before, nigga
and a blue corvette
half a love, never appealed to me
ah, get down, get down, brown sugar
i was into you, but i'm over it now
maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
i said, "i would never fall, unless it's you i fall into"
i can feel you over here, i can feel you over here
even when i lose, i'm winning
well, i'm back, yes, i'm back
i'm gonna say it like a man
say i'm not your type
though i respect that a lot
don't let me down, oh, no
the weather outside's changing
the other night, dear,
i can see the fakes, so when i look in your direction
see the old folks tied in white ropes
baby, i'm yours ooh
whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
dandelion into the wind you go
maybe we'll find a brand new ending
woe is me
i guess i wish
and what we got, got no hold on me
nobody touch me, i'm the righteous
i don't give a damn
but i guess i must be doing something wrong
and you ask me why i grow my hair
i look in the mirror, and i see all my flaws
i was upside down
uh huh, uh huh yeah, rihanna
got a long list of ex-lovers
i hear that father dip is gonna blow the blues
all the bullshit that you put me through
and if you don't want to be down with me, dum dum diddy
whoah, you stress me out, you kill me
so make sure i have no clues
and nothing but good times to share
you got a way of makin' me spend up all my cash
their ideas made me want to spit
i got all i need all i need i'm
the darkness is falling, the sky has turned gray
i want your belly
casting plagues my styles crossing the switchblades
since she brought you down
'cause i didn't want anyone thinkin' i still care, i don't, but
if i don't find me a honey to help me spend my money
yesterday i saw a lion kiss a deer
but my dreads too thick and that's alright
and you coming back to me is against all odds
you don't even have to do too much
ooh wah, ooh wah cool, cool kitty
loves me better
you had my heart inside of your hand
well, then let the time be near
just-a hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
watermelon sugar
because you're petty, you're just a butter knife, i'm a machete
watch those trains pull out of sight
you're like an angel
but i need to tell you something
you'll be chasin a dream like freddy.
but nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you to all give a check
and you're spending all your time
your lips are so fine
to raise the roof and have some fun
and i pray there ain't no hell
'til the stars fall from the sky
yeah i knew love
and i think you know exactly what i mean
but i can't put nobody else above you
we all play the game, and when we dare
bite that tattoo on your shoulder
baby just to wake up with you
i was born addicted to the money
if you stay forever, let me hold your hand
young but i'm not that bold
oh moon of alabama
makes me feel this way ain't nobody
so dust off your
i've had my run
i knew just what i would do
gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
don't wanna be
you just don't want to be down
we'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
and if it's right, i don't care
losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
don't underestimate the things that i will do
not to say but if you only knew
she never makes a scene
his love never felt right
my tongue gets tied when i try to speak
and i take you as you are
nowhere to turn no way
they won't stay, they won't stay for too long now
ah, come down, brown sugar
why we got the same taste for the finer things
mismatched fits, that was way before you know me
'cause i can play the part so well
like you never heard before
ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
i can see it in your eyes
and that summer feelin'
married
ripping your narrow mentality nothing but flavor
all the young dudes what dudes?
four years, no calls
now my heart feel like an ember
and if you don't know me well, well
haven't i made it obvious
i'm only here passing time in her arms
a taste of strife
'til the rivers all run dry
you came to the table
such a lovely face
and on the streets again
their uninvited guest
i don't wanna think about you nah, nah
i think you almost ready
all this time how could you not know, baby?
mamaaa,
we play hard with our plastic guns
snapping three, four
ah, how come you taste so good, good?
where all them characters from the first street they meet
i won't slow down won't slow down
how can i love when i'm afraid to fall?
so look at me now
and just reach out your hands and touch me
i didn't need a shove 'cause i fell in love
baby, baby, baby, oh
'cause i want this to be something
i know i can treat you better than he can
yeah i wanna take you with me
buy his mother gin and roses
you and me hmm
and if you can't tell i'm a restless girl
get broken off for chunk when they feel the funk.
oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
fuck the chase
it's only right that
no, i don't know how
the dearest things i know are what you are.
dramatic, asiatic, not like many
when somebody say your name
and your mom and your sister and your job
heavy metal thunder
it's not very easy living all alone
to love, yeah
waiting for the light to take us in
decided to follow my heart
down this river every turn
but try to play it cool
you're always late with your kisses
you're the one i need
there ya are, see
and take him and mold him and make him
your neck looks like a goose
just making my way
finding your love i've found my adventure,
is that you just don't realize how much i love you
tell the driver make the radio play and i'm singing like
my name is blue canary, one note spelled l-i-t-e
your skin so fine
oh, 'cause you know i'd walk a thousand miles
but you played it with a beating
alexander's ragtime band
didn't mean to make you cry,
but baby, there you go again, there you go again making me love you
way up
but it don’t make sense
and i feel something so wrong
some men's thirsts are never filled.
and if i chose the one i'd like to help me through
bring your sweet loving
at teatime
they wrote in a letter
while you play air guitar
and you were bound to see
see, i want you back for good want you back for good
so he packed his gear an' his trusty gun
burning hot through my veins
ah, get down to the ground, brown sugar
i don't need your love
pero ya ya no tengo más na' que hacer aquí aquí
magic madness heaven sin
it's no good unless he loves you all the way
the road that was broken
i guess that's why i've never given up
when i see potential i just gotta see it through
and that's the only way to prove you love them
have a break from a take of me acting ill
started giving up on the word forever
reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
i love you pretty baby, well i say you love me too
you get under my skin
said i'll always be your friend
they follow me with open eyes
i see trouble on the way
it's just a noisy hall, where there's a nightly brawl
i was a diesel fixer, fixed a diesel, diesel fixed me
guiding me home
so when i roll on you rappers, you better be ready to die
oh it really lifts my heart
hand me the world on a silver platter
sick and tired of bitches
now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
and let me go?
and that's where the hornet stung me
and it sounds just like a song
hear my words that i might teach you
you look like my next mistake
babe, it's rotten to the core
anytime, night or day
'cause darling i'm a nightmare
just what you will say when you get home
seems it never rains in southern california
to wish you happiness
why you actin' all sweet
if it means having you to keep
where our eyes are never closing
moved to the city in a broke-down car, and
you shoulda heard him just around midnight
snapping one, two
at the body shop shop
why you always wanna act like lovers
all the way
you're dangerous, i'm loving it
you can tell me when it's over mm
makes me feel half alive
her laugh, her laugh
it's like you'd do anythin' for my affection
please don't take my sunshine away
all i wanna do is get into your head
so the bar is where i go
don't want to go by the devil
when you know down inside
loved you night and day,
here i go, ah
i'll be damned
bick back and chad, i trap the bag for y'all
tastes like strawberries
girl, you got stars for eyes you do
and your craigslist couch and the way your voice sounds
and i know the time's gonna fly
everyone's itching for beauty, but just scratchin' the surface
you think i'm losing? psst, picture that
just the memory of your face
you got off on the hurtin'
and i guess you'll never know, no
some people search for a fountain
singin' these big city blues city, yeah
it was ever-green
she got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
blue like my corvette its in and outside
that you know i'll never drop, yeah
end up an enemy
won't you help me share my load help me share my load
ha ha ha!
does he think that i'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?
nobody's gonna get me on another rap
he said
now she's gone and we're through
and we were sittin' there in high school, my school
i have some food in my bag for you
think of me in the depths of your despair
and i call to you, i call to you
already on my way
you made your bed, so you gotta lay
i am the roughest, roughest, roughest. say what? say what?
aerodynamically cutting through danger
it's just you and i, and no other guys
'cause when we get behind closed doors
and old john sutter soon came to wish
across the harbor
don't grumble, give a whistle
show me how you do how you do
in two months you replaced us
and there ain't no one going to turn me 'round
i realized quickly when i knew i should
you could use me 'cause i still want that
look in to your heart you will find
why yes, you drive a toyota, please define flex
loved-ones forsaken,
why you calling me up saying sorry again
you got to have a j-o-b if you wanna be with me
movin' in
good on paper, picture perfect
ain't it funny rumors fly
nothings gonna cut it that's the hard truth
'cause there's nothing
oh, well, a-bless my soul, but what's wrong with me?
streaming through the waves in your hair
actin like they wanna know me
two girls that's a tandem
so if you want it, got to bleed for it baby
oh yes, we can love
here we are, all of the lights
i was a workshop owner in the gulch for the people
mmm you got to, got to bleed, baby
seven deadly sins
when i was living in the blue
boom, bam, god, damn!
i do for you
and all i want is for that to be okay
i have never wanted anything else
is where is the ring
from his face
you can tell me when it's over, mm
some would thank the lord for their deliverance
that's what people say
when you're feeling in the dumps
better than he can
start the car, i know a whoopee spot
she's got you
cat's eyes
without any closure
they leave me breathless tears are gonna fall
you can't tell me it's not worth trying for
in the meantime, in between time
it was really, really good
nazareth, i'm fucked up
then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud
everything is my fault
for they came like
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
the sea, the sky, for you and i
i don't share your greed
boy wanna what no boy outta my way
lo siento mucho farru, pero me voy
we're all a-payin'
but in any way, dear
thought when i grew up
through the carnival we watch them go round and round
there's so much i need to say to you so many reasons why
so it's gonna be forever
i'm way too good at goodbyes
if i knew i'd be with you
before i met you baby, never knew what i was missing
you hate me now and i feel the same way
i'll wait for you, i promise you, i will
that i'd found my destiny
didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
no time to have you lurking
and love me like you tried before
one thing, i don't know why
oh i'll be your daydream i'll wear your favorite things
flat on your back from the raps that i spat, spit.
yeah someday oh someday oh
please see me
if you were still here with me
and your heart gets bored with your mind and it changes you
too many holes in the crust of the earth
i want you back, want you back want you back, want you back
you won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home
am i blue?
i would not give in, i would not partake
we'll take this way too far
don't go look at me with that look in your eye
so much love that i cannot hide
hoping that i'd run into you one last time
looking pale feeling chic
easily amused
but baby here goes
i wish i knew, i wish i knew you wanted me i wish i knew
all the things that i've done
i know you will still love me the same
party girls don't get hurt
and i'm
you and me, hmm
oh, let me go home
there's nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be
you don't care you never did
and every star in the sky is taking
watch the sun rise along the coast
but i pray there ain't no hell
now take a look at me now, 'cos there's just an empty space
did we both think that this
since you went away the days grow long
walking fast faces pass and i'm homebound
designer crimes or it wouldn’t be me
hey what you doing with a girl like that
and a baaa baaa here.
i say make you no leave me diko

gypsy tailwind

please, see me
he made their horrid wings.
now i ain't lookin' to fight with you
it was a cold, snowy, rainy afternoon
on just doing what we're told
we just need a face to face
every night in your sleep
lose yourself in wild romance
and i won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway
one step closer
and a neigh neigh there.
oh, you can fit me
but fuck i'm still so empty
everybody ain't got it, understand son, yeah
sayin' something about a queen
i don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
cause i can't reach out to call you
every woman, child and man
'cause i don't wanna see you go
just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
gotta get out now, gotta run from this
oh, she's gonna shimmy 'til her garters break
well, don't you think that's kind of neat?
it's been a real hard night
maybe say you do
well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels
take my hand, we'll be fine
but it's all in my head
before you go to sleep at night
in this institution
got a lot of love, well you better save it for me
this morning when i woke
i've tried to let you go
who married young and then retired
but i never call and i never text, yeah
and you've got a smile
boy don't you know you can't escape me
you are ahead by a century
well, some fell prey to hostile arrows

and i won't be your victim
i'm sorry but
i'll hold you down and not let you go
he was shy
all around the world all around the world people wanna be loved
so think about it if you're trying to go
and you would hide away and find your peace of mind
nothin' else can break my heart like
i was hopin' it was a lie
my poor heart's jumpin'
i pray every single day
a brother's way to leave
we'll play jacks and uno cards
we go higher and higher
on and on, and on and on, my cypher keep's movin' like a rollin' stone
you need to get done, done, done, done
i don't have the right
dropping all my money
i know that i must do what's right
i know it's all my fault
i never felt so low and i was vulnerable
we crash and we burn
and i try
there were peasants singin' and drummers drumming
you're planning to get on one knee
a baby boy was found
would you mind if i tried to make a pass at it
and i know the
they say, "just snap your fingers"
i learned to play on the safe side, so i don't get hurt
and it was
this ain't hollywood, this is a small town
hey, just like a woman?
haters, i don't understand them
i designed this rhyme
i put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
when you walk, let your heart lead the way
i got all i need, all i need to be free
well, how can i forget you girl?
that i know you can't afford
every day, you'll hear me say
of your hands never had
i say my darling you are wonderful tonight
watch that engine when we start to go!
you have my heart
now my heart feel like december
just like i told you before, yeah before
finally able to see
but now i know i only hurt myself
all your loving, pretty baby.
life what you trippin on
if i could just see you
i'll never let you down again, again
doesn't mean i love you anymore
give me my freedom for as long as i be
and with all the achings inside
cause it wasn't yours
was the distance between
baby, 'cause in the dark
i'm losing count
i said that's when it's callin' me back home
you're more than a sunshine in my eyes
don't fuck up the base
oh, ain't she sweet?
wasn't blowing money, i was stacking it
slowly, it's taking over me
remind me of us tears are gonna fall
when you know you're 'bout to cry
you're going back to nothing
cause if you think i care about you now
i'll never let go
in other words, until the end of time
but i have seen this all before
your love was handmade for somebody like me
all pins and needles when i meet somebody new and i
i found a guy, told me i was a star
'cause i know in my heart babe
i never miss a beat
and the feeling of the wind in your face
wonder what a nigga might do for that
then somebody sings
boys only want love if it's torture
i needed to lose you to love me
and she
love me, won't you
singing someday it'll bring me back to you
of my primitive ancestry
that's the deal, i'm straight out of farmville, va.
they'll zip you up and dress you down and stand you in a row
i've got to get ready just a few minutes more
i know all the
tell me what you want to do
and he says, "here is your throat back, thanks for the loan"
the sea, the sky, the you and i
what's going on
and when i die and when i'm gone
all the pain that we've been through
to find out i'm the number one solo, uhh.
you know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
i'm such a lonely one
i dont know why i've been running away from love
lord, don't she make me proud
when you hold me
when i'm sick when i'm sad
well, them ol' boys town in texas chew copenhagen
and it's almost, and it's, and it's almost independence day
for you and i
wild brahma bull riders
and that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
it don't matter, how it all went wrong
and
but i'm much greater, the best
i swam across
i ain't got no visa
aqua sea foam shame
they look at me
test one of us man then
i can hear the people, people, people shouting out
everything, i wanna know it all
they say that money talks but you're not saying nothing
and you tell me
said you could keep them
it's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
as we dance the night away
and haven for the elderly
what mac-11 even boom with the bass down
after midnight
so define it, here's your walking papers, sign it
oh, oh, oh
baby, i'm done
intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now
and you'll miss, and you'll miss,
my little baby
with blue skies ahead yes
so don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
in the same old drugs everyone else takes
we're falling in love
how was i to know
it must be exhausting always rooting for the antihero
blackbird singing in the dead of night
that we almost had it all you're gonna wish you
it's time to be a big girl now
ten thousand people, maybe more
with an oink oink here.
say you drive a chevy
and i take it everywhere i go
seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
since you been gone
somehow i always end up feeling bad
and we'll never be worlds apart
there in my rear view mirror disappearing now
cause i can't stand to see you this way.
i would give it all i would sacrifice
if we go down
fight fire with fire fire
what can i say
yeah, drums beating, cold english blood runs hot
the second you say you'd like me too
it's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
drop the verse for nine planets
yo, listen up here's a story
i'm not ashamed to come, and plead to you baby
oh, i'm just holding on for tonight
since eighteen hours ago
and this'll help things turn out for the best
because you're the one who told me that you were in love, oh, oh
and all my friends they tell me they see
he came third or fourth and there were more than one or two
i think i'm cracking up
her holding your hand
to remain oh
that's the only thing i've plenty of, baby
my head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
had them cast away
i can't control the soul flowin' in me
'cause something is happening and you don't know what it is
loves me better nobody, baby
the lady of rage.
i like you, i do, mmm, i do i do
let it all go let it all go
my darkest hours
but i know what's on your mind
will i ever be the same?
it’s not fair, yeah, i know
is baby, be friends with you
maybe we can see things the same
they don't really know
'tis the answer, 'tis the end and all of living
it's always times like these when i think of you
so you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
be sleeping on your rhymes 'til i start to snore
those memories start to play
so on to be, want to be competition
while you're bringing me back to life
when you need someone to cheer you, all the way
and i know just why you could not
but all my exes live in texas
understand i'm seeing right through
i'm just a lucky lucky hound
i love you pretty baby,
but with you girl there is no more lies
when dreams were all they gave for free
i don't know if it's fair but i thought,
we're gonna chug-a-lug and shout
what did you get for me?"
she's all i wanna be so bad
love, and love alone, the world is seeking,
'cause you're amazing
in her direction
baby 'cause you're the one that i love
the rest of his life, he took the stand
someone who's out every week day
that i'll only stay with you one more night oh-oh-oh
just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
how he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
and i, i, i, i, i can't stop
then we danced and she whispered, "i need you
so the story it is told
one week in we let the story begin
said i want a billion now nothing less is adequate
it's been so long
schemin'! and let me tell you bout my life
and do my best to keep you satisfied
got a long list of
want you back, want you back
you'll be too
lost time is never found, can the dj please reverse it?
when love and trust are gone
rang true, sure rang true
number one with a bullet, i'm a power pack
you're toxic, i'm slippin' under
baby you're the one that i love
well it's bound to take your life
and drop some smooth lyrics 'cause it's '88
now we are on top of the world, 'cause that's just how we do do it
when you were always on my mind
such a lovely place such a lovely place
little darlin', come with me
sunday morning rain is falling and i'm calling out to you
but my love, he doesn't love me, so i tell myself
slowly lurching toward your favorite city
and i said, baby, i'll treat you better than i did before
to ugly duckling girls like me
women there don't treat you mean
we were love drunk, waiting on a miracle
give an exhibition
i'm a barbie girl, in the barbie world
i'll just keep on making the same mistakes
like we are in the present
when you know you're
i keep my head up high
you say you're fine, i know you better than that
sea, sky, you and i
they say love hurts
too many snags
tell me, why are we wasting time
just sitting in a cloud, oh, wow
into forever
that's why i'm in the shape i'm in
and i feel like today's the day
they had
understand, to these female fans, i'm sex
if i ain't got you, yeah

the creator conductor of poetry
well i've been throwing down the whiskey
i've been hoping
took an oath, i'ma stick it out to the end
and must have whiskey

in this wild unsettled land.
they'll tell you i'm insane
and we'll be together, this time is forever forever, girl

and in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
like it doesn't exist
you're my end and my beginning
dark-sad or bright-gald
pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
you're making me feel brand new
dancing on the hood
and then we make love
in this world, it's just us
down to school

there was a fanfare blowin' to the sun

so full of the superficial
though the breezes through the
who watches over you keep the nightlight on inside the
lucky, lucky girl yeah, yeah

how he loved the old race horses
i got new rules, i count 'em
paint a picture for you and me

i wish i was like you
what i like about you baby
you can watch me back it up, i'll be gone in the a.m. yeah

after you've gone and left me cryin'
sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
maybe you'll start slipping slowly
no way you're never gonna shake me
i'd like to make it with you
it's like i got this music in my mind
that live inside me
doing the right thing
the sun-burned hands i used to hold
little darling come alone
but i still can't seem to tell you why
why do lies make my love stronger
relax
and she sweet like texas tea
mamaaa, life had just begun,
"we are programmed to receive
on our own cuttin' class for the thrill of it
count your blessings to find what you look for whoa
and so was i
when somebody needs you
at the same time i wanna hug you

then i could fill the world with all my problems
i'll be right here, baby, you know i'll sink or swim

heartbreakers gonna break
and i... will swallow my pride
now i finally found my wings
lights shining out lights shining out
sunday morning, rain is falling
and i love what you do
you make me not wanna die
singing at the top of both our lungs
amen.
we could've had it all you're gonna wish you never had met me
you throw it in the yard
what would you say
just bundle up my coffin cause
all the young dudes i've wanted to do this for years, ha ha ha!
that's so very lovely made from love hey
the bitches want fame
but it's been so long since i last prayed
but you really just a bitch
putrid, foul and gangrenous,
love is all you need...
promise i won't let you down
that your love for me is real
at seventeen i learned the truth
but she
south of the border
to everyone who cannot hold a pen
can't feel anything, when will i learn?
we can't go nowhere exotic
to put my tootsies in an upper berth.
break of dawn
come into me there's no distance in between our love
ain't talkin' 'bout love
i’ve been going through this on my own
this isn't my season
that i really do
the moral of my oral ammunition rendition
life is a whole lot better
makes no sense
well, i dreamed i saw the silver spaceships lying
doing the wrong thing
follow bullshit y'all give the hype to
friends i said friends
say when everything looked so dark?
just a speck of dust within the galaxy
take me into your loving arms
repeat after me now
that's when it's callin' me
best laid
so why can't you see
when i heard your song
and that's why i never want us to be apart hey hey
'cause i give you all of me
please recognize i'm trying baby
are sometimes very few
in this wild
you know you're semi-good lookin'
for a destination
mama, oooh
stare in the morning shroud
some people live for the power, yeah
and there's one more boy, he's from my past
like a river i flow
'cause certain things are out of our control
and i'm loving every step i take
and tried to make me forget where i came from
making love out of nothing at all
or with a nasty scar
all around the world they're no different than us no
wanna give myself to you
i mean, what have you got to lose?
i was mistaken
in this world to carry on, to carry on
i'm looking for the words to say
and the stories that we tell
they'll be huggin', and a kissin'
i wish i had words to tell i wish
it's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
baby, you're the one that i love
baby i'm done
there are pretty things to you
getting drunk on the past we were livin' in
here's another saturday night and i ain't got nobody
yeah all alone i watch you watch her
and if you try and come get it, yo, i'ma show you who's with it
and i'm saying goodbye
youth is wasted on the young
play me the classics
well that's okay baby only
when i compliment her, she won't believe me
i ain't hard to find
and you give me all of you, oh-oh
this beautiful lady
now all i think about
i never stop falling for you, you never stop play with my head, my heart
and give me
baby take a chance
if i have to sleep on your doorstep
who
and without further notice, he asks you how it feels
all night long all night...all night
i can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
you just don't want to be down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
like a little schoolmate in the school yard
she wouldn't mind her business, boy did she get salted
well, you were a magazine, i was a plain jane
i could leave it in the past but you're holding on to what you never had
the blood, it's in my hair
everyone i do right does me wrong
i can hear the fireworks
i'm laid back
cause every time i open up, it hurts
and when you need it, baby, just jump under the covers yeah
nobody wey know the paranoia oh
i rock rough and stuff with my afro puffs. rage!
well he took it to the city
we could be beautiful
i'll be your hova
spend some time, but this time ain't even
so always look on the bright side of death
flyin' mother nature's silver seed
and i might never get there but i'm gonna try
as you shoot across the sky
i had to find the passage back
i gotta go home
you say you want action satisfaction
it was over my head
i can't describe
too much damn wind and not enough whiskey
'cause even if they understand
been trying to find a reason for this stuff
and i know your favorite
i made a promise, i'll never run and hide
i know life would suck without you whoa oh oh
we're going to have a party! yeah... ugh
you know it's not the same
gonna take some time to do the things we never had
tell me you're aching for me now
you raise up your head and you ask, "is this where it is?"
someone who feels like a holiday
i just hope that it gets to you
and out in the darkness the whippoorwills cry
i need something "you proof,"
if you don't know my crew by now then
you're still in my heart still in my heart
you keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
but i don't, i don't
ain't talkin' bout love
oh don't ask why
girl, i'm sorry i was blind
we think that politics is such a waste of time
i'm breathing underwater
maybe one day you'll feel lonely
flyin’ private side by side with da
and by the spring of
you tilted my hand
you're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
come on now follow my lead
if we go down then we go down together
that's why i'm shoutin' for the world to know,
you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
and god tell us the reason
you're just like the ocean
the meaning of her name
wish i were
in the presence of your chico ah!
and he keeps his pockets full of spending loot
ain't nobody selling nothing "you proof"
never had
i just wanna be there hey hey
and if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
wish that i was young, what have i become
all the longing, seeking, striving, waiting, yearning
when your days and your nights get a little bit colder oh
i can't pretend i'm not
just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing
it's so strange sometimes
are you tryin' to put me in shame
i can't describe what i'm feeling
and it's all because of you
spendin' money to compensate, compensate
when i fold you see the best in me
yes i'm saving all my love for you
so pick a bc date 'cause you're history
feel so pathetic and i want to scream
you say you drive around the town till you just get bored
you could be my destiny's child on the scene girl
was i a fool to let you break down my walls
you make it easier when life gets hard
ain't she nice?
cause only love can hurt like this
samson thought delilah was on the square
needed anyone
ta neige, acadie, fait des larmes au soleil
forget the hearse 'cause i never die
got a head of shattered dreams
that don't change the way i feel
you shoulda heard me just around midnight
oh what a thing to have done
and all i gotta do is act naturally
you know i love you so
you're the only one who really knew me at all
take these sunken eyes and learn to see
can't believe i chose you
oh, her eyes, her eyes
i gave it all just to hold you close
and love's something that money can't buy
that the physical things
to something worst
now i'm standing back from it, i finally see the pattern
when i hear the silly things that you say.
everybody, everybody on my way
i keep thinkin' about you baby
i can never say it on the phone say it on the phone
it's this sunrise
and murmur vague obscenities
to do that jazz
i don't want to straight-face you
but every time she asks me, "do i look okay?"
they'll tell you i'm insane i'm insane
with their dreams of finding fortunes
"relax, " said the night man
it doesn't let go
try to forget how you could never meet me in the middle
and all i ask of dying is to go naturally
it'll leave you breathless, mm oh
she's always a lady
these fancy things will never come in between
i learned to play on the safe side so i don't get hurt
you grabbin' me hard 'cause you know what you found
has come and gone away
saw you there and i thought
'cause you had too much
lose the love they sought to gain
to all of you with heartache that remains
while all the women came and went
you tell me i shouldn't stress out
and now it's crossed out in red
lucky i'm in love with my best friend
wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga
right now i need a miracle
i need somebody who can love me at my worst
high
dreamin' of you and it's crazy
beauty in all she is
they signed a treaty
"this could be heaven or this could be hell"

nice to meet you where you been
my nerves, are tingling
to get you facts when someone attacks your imagination
and i read those pages.
all the sick and twisted nights that i've been waiting for ya
when you find me there, you'll search no more
no escape from reality
take my hand stop put
how many times do i have to tell you?
he already knows that my love is fire
that's so you that's so me
yeah, fingers trace your every outline, oh yeah, yeah
too much repetition
and just the way he looked at me
don't let me go
of an old mustang
you know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
and it's lighting up the dark
i said no romance without finance
in the morning probably hating myself
we know this thing wasn't built to last
in my stomach is
and now the moment is all that it meant
i'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
but i know you need to get done, done, done, done
cause you see people, people, people, people
and it's looking for a rhythm like you
across the water across the deep blue ocean
get out of my heart
i swear to god when i come home
the next, the next, the next
and me falling for it screaming that i'm right
for you
come on, barbie, let's go party
why don't we leave it at that
so, it may be too soon, i know
easy come, easy go, will you let me go
hey, hey baby.
i'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh
did ya know that my dreams, they're all the same
uh huh, uh huh hov
she's such an angel
cause i can see the sun light up the sky
colors and promises
with a single word
and no, that's not a myth, and if you try to riff
'cause everything that glitters is not gold.
sign cds and i sign breasts
i wanna crush it in my hands
come on, let your colors burst
me, all of my plain jane glory
we have been heaven blessed
protection, we won't need
it's hunting season
if i got right then you might like it
living in your precious memory
i never ever want us to be apart ah o hey oo
in the back of the chevy
he socked her in the choppers
your savage love
cause i could give you all you want
carry the news
it's two in the morning, the rain is pouring
have you ever thought just maybe
chills run down my spine
i know i'll be in your heart 'til the end
like guardian angels, it's always near
and i could use some love
for revolution
that's just the bestest band what am, honey lamb
it was as much of the alphabet as she knew how to use
and bless the paragraph i manifest
and it's almost independence day
i should not be left to my own devices
and places where they send you, and it's easy to go
then one day feels like you wake up
babe, baby, baby, i'm gonna leave you
do you think time would pass me by
i'm gonna stay right here by your side
get that shit inside your head
was i a fool to let you break down my walls?
i can see the lights way out in the harbor
and a quack quack here.
i guess sometimes you find the one
there's a fire
i pi-ty the fool, that gets.
for a man to beg
we roc-a-fella
all i know
i fell in love with your pretty baby face
so i cut you off
now you're not too good for me, my dear
if i ain't got you, you, you
you show me my scars are beauty marks, beauty marks
ain't nobody nobody
sent him here for loving him
we gonna go walkin' through the park every day
know something now i didn't before
that was floating on the breeze
a lucky, lucky girl
you always bring me back
when somebody loves you
fools, said i, "you do not know
laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
my life right now and the place i am
uh, this shit is not random
for thursday's child is sunday's clown
she says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
ah, gonna take the time
all night long all night, yeaz, all night
and it's not too long before you point it out
when monday comes around?
so then when i'm finished
they're just built that way
cause it's all i can do
'cause tonight is the night for feeling alright
do you ever feel like a plastic bag
i won't ever let a shorty go and set me up
like the longines symphonette, it doesn't rest
friends
the place is wrong
and the sign said, "the words of the prophets
because something is happening here but you don't know what it is
you look as good as the day i met you
i know you're thinking i'm heartless
she got married to a boy like you
words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
talkin' in my sleep at night
and that's why i hang my hat in tennessee
baby, baby, baby
and that's when you need me there
'cause i'm back on the track
i disguise as altruism like some kind of congressman
i gave a second chance to cupid
won't you let my darling know that
put him in the rear, back there where he can't see clear
we play games of love to avoid the depression
you used to tell me we'd run away together
and you played it tears are gonna fall
when all the things you are, are mine!
a little tired of remembering
and baby, i'll be movin' on
who could ask for more
i had to fall
for the past five days
his dueling scar
i keep you with me in my heart
there's nothing you can teach me
there was a band playin' in my head
to the next whiskey bar
i got all i need, all i need, i'm flying
phone's blowin' up, ringin' my doorbell
i'll tell you how i almost died
i got some money 'cause i just got paid
we now must say goodbye
last night all alone in a barroom
grab on my waist and put that body on me
you want someone you can show off
then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
you'll always be a part of me
there are many here among us
down that mississippi
i've got you like a habit
television man is crazy
she's so beautiful and i tell her everyday
come on, be my baby, come on
'cause you take me as i am
she'll be selling plastic flowers on a sunday afternoon
just like i always wanted but i'm so sorry
we keep this love in a photograph
i guess sometimes you fall in love
another kiss and you'll be mine
tomorrow may be too late
because i'm easy come, easy go,
ooh
the joker and the queen
cause every time you hurt me, the less that i cry
sure, ken
too many people on the bus from the airport
who will share this feeling
i can't give you anything but love
but without you i'm incomplete
with the moon keeping watch over me
saying, "this is it, i've had enough," 'cause like
and don't forget the joker
then she lit up a candle
'cause all around the world people want to be loved yeah
a million colours of hazel, golden and red
leave you when the summer comes along
i type a text but then i never mind that shit
and no other, could give me more love
and the be's who snooze leave diseased and bruised
we just need to slow the motion
boy, wanna- what? no boy, outta my way
they'll tell you i'm insane insane
it calls me on and on across the universe
the sad and lonely one, oh yes i am
tonight i'm getting over you
like this a slow dance
and what will she do with thursday's rags
oh darlin' 'cause you'll always be my baby
love's a game wanna play ay
your title, namely me because i'm homicidal
all night long all night, all night all night
her lips, her lips
but together we could be the perfect soulmates
the moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
yes, i'm in a bang
no, nobody but me can keep me safe
and the snowmen melt
now everybody clap your hands
one by one then two by two
come along with me on, down to new orleans
and stepping to me, yo that's the wrong move
holdin' me close
i always dreamed of a solemn face
take me away from here and be my man"
know i'm not perfect but i hope you see my worth
i've been movin' on since we said goodbye
and it's the only thing that i know know
to lose it all
and gambling's for fools
don't speak before we say too much
it's for sure i'm gonna love you
now the band's there to greet us
everybody agrees
oh, you know, you know
and a cool, cool night
and every time you walk out, the less i love you
there'll come a time when you'll regret it
we're gonna let it all hang out
but if the truth makes love last longer
until you find the love you've missed, you're nothing, alfie
in anticipation for precipitation stack chips for the rainy day
screaming at my mirror like i'm fucking drunk
but you know it's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
"wait for me to come home"
but you gotta give credit when credit is due.
songs with all our childhood friends
it's okay, things happen for
it decays and dies
let me drop bands, put a jewel in ya teeth
it's not anyone, not anyone
and you still let me win
all in all is all we are
met a boy in green, i thought it'd be me
i swear it will get easier
if i could just hold you tonight
i'm part of you indefinitely
after a hurricane comes a rainbow
when you're looking at me
on all your wasted crying
the last chapter would be about
wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
and when his wife said "hey now!
what else could i say?
you know how to just make me want to
was i gay?
i fell in love, now i feel nothin' at all
i'll give my all to you
think i know it's with me
wait a minute!
and all the time we spent
one day he caught a winner
and all the things that you do
well you ask me 'bout the clothes i wear
lord, don't they love to talk
i wish that i could push a button
sneaking in l.a. when the lights are low
oh my darling you are wonderful tonight
we'll stay as we are
within the sound of silence
inside these pages, you just hold me
loves all of you
but i never call and i never text yeah
i would be, i'd be caught in the undertow
i was spending my nights in the rain
now it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now
and when you told me that you hated my friends
feel the ghost, you shiverin'
maybe it's the way you say my name
you could use me 'cause i still want that your savage love
and i've been keeping all the letters
baby, i'm yours
love me, love me, love me
an' patched up the crack in the liberty bell
galileo, figaro - magnificoo
and then someone screams out
and i can't see the end of this
i'm gonna have to blow this town
carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
for all the times that you rained on my parade
everytime i see you all the rays of the sun are
i don't but, you still hit my phone up
living on the spotlight can kill a man outright
ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
the name is big daddy, yes, big not little
and give her money on the side
to explain in due time
yeah, yeah, yeah
darling, i can't go on without you
now i'm realizing that the uglyness i saw
you just walked out of one of my dreams
there's not a thing that i would change
you must think that i'm a fool
for all tomorrow's parties
whenever i want you, all i have to do is
and if you don't want to be down with me, you don't want to pick from
'cause you're crying like a baby, but do i look like your mommy?
but we can love
for the last time
didn't see what's going on, but now i know
there's only one thing you should know
way too many heads, need a steady view
every time he says he loves me
yeah! yeah!
you're thinking about the aisle
and i know you could fall for a thousand
just wanna go home
they
and i know just what to prove
oh, that talk of opportunities, tv breaks and movies
you wanna get with the wickedness, with that.
you won't ever be alone
it all it all it all tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
it all, it all, it all tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
i took her home to my place
followin' his legend into the west
he swept me off my feet
aching, begging you to come help begging baby, please
pierced through the heart but never killed
baby, baby it's you
by hangin' all over me in a crowd
woah okay
some people live for the fortune
if perfect's what you're searchin' for, then just stay the same
and i won't ever let you go
you should be made to wear earphones
for all that jazz
i can hear it callin' me the way it used to do
the ace of spades
he'd not one penny to his name.
it starts with one thing
guess i'm all torn up
but you won't see me break, call you up in three days
i got it all, yeah, i'm young, rich, and handsome
yes papa
always look on the right side of life
and it's me you need to show
don't leave me stuck here in the streets no, no
that i'll only stay with you one more night oh, oh-oh oh
everyone you meet all night
how to be brave?
are the nights we were tangled up in your bed
wine, women and song
cause i might snap
said nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
give your all to me
but baby now
who do you think pays for all this rubbish
now that i'm famous, i got hoes all around me
in this world, carry on, to carry on
when the sun shines, we'll shine together
i've been hoping somebody loves you in the ways i couldn't
if you ain't got the class to flee
be that girl for a month
i know i'm not the one you really love
about a little guy
if i don't get it i'ma throw a fucking tantrum, woah
when i held your hair up
gravity's holdin' me back
yeah we're both a lot to handle
i got winter in my blood
lead her up the stairwell
i see you lying down with me, i see you waking up
so i give her the car
lifted out like vine motion i spend time stroking
it's the sweetest thing
no sleep, you keep them lullabies
that's just like a woman?
they keep me thinking rolling in the deep
it was definitely a blessing wakin' beside you
finally i can see you crystal clear
i know that we can't wait
get with the uh, roughest, roughest.
thirty-thousand wheels are rollin'
everything has
i always thought i'd be with someone else
oh it's so funny to be seeing you after so long, girl.
now i know
the only home he's known
if you say it's alright don't lie, baby, don't lie
that's what i been missin'
i swear to god, i can see
you got me cornered and my hands are tied
i'm just a poor boy, i need no sympathy,
that's how deep it goes, if it's real
come to the ground, now children
i believed all of your dreams are fruition
and never really had a chance
put your arm 'round her shoulder
if i ain't got you with me baby
i never knew what i was missing.
life's a piece of shit
and what good would it be
if you need a lover baby
i miss you in my front seat
neurotic to the bone
but unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
now he's a brilliant mistake
if you still want it
make a man want to leave
this is where i wanna be with you
yeah someday oh, someday oh
yes, i'm saving all my love
princes kept the view
i
so i hung my head and cried.
yeah, i need something "you proof,"
the words of love in whispers
take these broken wings and learn to fly
but a
we could've had it all you're gonna wish you
i know that you'll be back boy
but my jaw hit the floor with the one, two
come on, let me hear you shout high
let it be your blaze of glory
pull the trigg mayne
no cure for love, there ain't no cure for love
the movie's gonna make me a big star
don't say i didn't say i didn't warn
you better find yourself a friend, my friend
e-lim-i-nate the negative
and no other could give me more love
lucky, lucky girl
did we hope on a star
count your
you won't ever be alone wait for me to come home
you'll be right back, baby
wish to the lord that i could be
i'm gonna hold you so close
stick out the tongue now, swallow really hard, uh
forsaken, forgotten without any love
the mistakes that it bears
keep that in mind
and i don't know how you do it
an' lit out grinnin' to follow the sun
and i was hangin' out with some my artsy friends
he has the finest penthouse i've ever seen in town
i make my wish upon a star
hoping that you'll understand
and there you are baby once again
captured effortlessly
if you say, "i'm always yours" ooh, oh
i think it must be
i've got a smile on my face
i am one of those
we never got it off on that revolution stuff
the feds rocking like we x-men
who watches over you
breathe me in
and i always know the name of the game
canadian cold front,
keep the nightlight on inside the birdhouse in your soul
you're crazy girl, crazy girl, don't control it
but every time you hurt me, the less that i cry
if my heart was torn in two
we get anxiety
your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
get a beer, idea or near stare, yeah
perhaps some food for thought
never gave me time of day, my dear
to the bright side of the road
falling in love
i i don't wanna let this go
a child can cry so much until you do everything they say
grab and check, cashing it
don't give that away to no one
you can blame my stupid...
should have known there was nothing about us i could change
"so i always keep a bottle near"
i'm on your magical mystery ride
i'm just too far
nobody text me in a crisis
well, i'll bet you i'ma gonna be a big star
and every star in the sky is taking aim at
in whatever comes our way
i tell you how i almost died, while you're bringing me back to life
homie, you fucked up
there must be some kind of way outta here
waiting around is a waste
plus possess the pin to crack the pyramid stone
seven or eleven
to the ocean i know
i can hear them calling, way from oregon
i tell myself you don't mean a thing
from the rising to the setting of the sun.
me voy, llegó la hora 'e partir partir
if i could just see you tonight
look up to the skies and see,
stupid girl
and she showed me the way
all your loving, pretty baby,
i needed to hate you to love me, yeah
where they pour coca cola just like vintage wine
just take me by surprise
oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
a bit too far
that i kinda wish i did
only takes a beat
born at the instant
i guess that now it's time she came back for good, yeah
and cry behind the door
you're my water when i'm stuck in the desert
the lord god made them all.
all around the world people want to be loved
now, did you look for me
tryin' to be a hero, winding up a zero,
all shades,
the past, she is haunted, the future is laced
and i scream
i want you next to me
some people live for the power yeah
to an island where we'd say i do
all that jazz
'cause when it comes to being dope, hot damn
when the sun shines, we shine together
you're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
all right now baby, it's all right now
and i found out my baby is dead
that ain't all, that ain't all i'll do for you
why you actin' so shy holdin' back, holdin' back?
every time every time, every time every time
all that i want in all of this world is you.
burn the spotlight, put the lights out, turn me on
sin city's cold and empty oh
boogaloo dudes stand up!
vroom vroom, i'll see you latеr, bye
her perfume was unspeakable
they call my home,
with a blue window
needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
you know i'm cool with that
getting down, riding all the highs
there's a bad moon on the rise
only love, only love
but i am
don't speak, just use your touch
now happy ever after it don't come so easily
do you have the time to listen to me whine
one red flag and i'm gone, already onto
only takes one note, i tell ya,
we've been a wreck together since
and you say, "what's mine?" and somebody else says, "well, what is?"
even wrote down the date, that i fell for you
new friends and new places to see
oh, i would fight for you, yeah, i'd lie for you
have you told me all? i've got things to say
you can be the pill to ease the pain
from my electrical well
and that's what i've got to face
you know you're gonna have to face it, you're addicted to love
you'd probably walk around the block like a little kid
and he's cute
six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
in abilene, sweet abilene
drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
ain't a bit bashful about speakin' their minds
i turned into the man i used to be, to be
ooooh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
well, he took it to the city
my baby makes me proud
girl you know i got you
but girl don't they warn
lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
every time it registers another birth
the blood moon is on the rise
ain't these tears
where i wore my welcome thin
how he walks
to all the ones who learn to live with bein' second-guessed
but i will have to avoid you if you're unemployed
so bad
yeah, okay
when my best friend caught you creepin'
i'll put a flower in your hair
this grand diva's runnin shit with the speed of a cheetah, meet a.

searching for meaning
all about your disease
love song.

with you, oh wow, oh wow
i'm in a field of dandelions
breathe deep, bottle it up
love is all you need love is all you need

is this just fantasy?
that's walking around with me
a style that can surprise ya
imagination, life is your creation
i would be the same as the ones who gave me my last name
if our love was a fairy tale
but a love so true
to remind myself how
everyone is gay
on the bright side of the road
i'm in the room, it's a typical tuesday night
when it wasn't even whole to start with
they slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
there's a bad moon on the rise, alright
some things are bound to be
she
i just want you back
all my days, i'll know your face
your bitter heart, cold to the touch
but now i know, i'm better sleeping on my own

upon their mother's breast
with the lyrical murderer cause my shit is rude. ooooh!
but i go right back and
someone who will share this feeling
when i see your face
ooh, baby, it's raining, raining

to cheat ourselves at solitaire
and i know just how to scheme

he indulged in fancy spending
pilot up in the sky
the dead man's hand again
trying to light up the dark
for whatever that means
she got the mercedes benz
handcuffed and she busts.
maybe we would be closer
and i'll be yours yours until the stars fall from the sky
a couple kids, one girl and a sailor
the second you say
i thought that i'd been hurt before
under the lamppost back on sixth street
gimme a break, give me a break
life can be short or long
the blues are more than a color
without true love we just exist, alfie
i'm just makin' my play
his eyes as clear as centuries
do you think time would pass us by
i don't know if i could ever go without
all blues
with your pretty baby face
possessing and caressing me
and if you don't want to be down with me, you just don't want to be
to those of us who knew the pain
stolen kisses, pretty lies
crowded city, there ain't nothin' free
i've come to talk with you again
reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
oh, you know why
i'll definitely snap man into two
we were staying in paris if we go down
you tell me lies that should be obvious to me
i swear i fall in love again damn
that i got in store for you.
and now i cry
there's a time that i remember
chased the high too far, too fast
i've told you one, two, three, four, five, six thousand times
wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
ooh whee, say you ought to come and see
don't want it now i'm with you
waiting for a love like this
i'm gonna love you ooh
under the open sky oh my baby i'm trying
bless you all and keep you on the road to better things
don't wanna talk about love
search your heart search your soul
but if you'll let me love you
yes, you can hold my hand if you want to
my friends try and tell me find a man of my own
rolling in the deep
who called to say, "come dance with me"
and he's no clown
you're the one i can always call
keep 'em laughin' as you go
if it ain't you, baby
all to buy some hong kong silver
because i see the love light in your eyes
i wish i knew you wanted me
out of self respect i'm out of bread
what was i gonna do?
marie antoinette met
take a deep breath and i get real high
so don't go look at me with that look in your eye
i know you wanna leave me
and i scream from the top of my
and whispered in the sounds of silence."
i am afraid
and the bruises on my heart
oh, holy father
every breath every hour has come to this
raised in the woods, so he knew ev'ry tree
someone else but you
you, you and i, girl
now i ain't lookin' to compete with you
but i'm here right now, right now
how could you tell me that you're goin' away?
i'm alabamy bound,
we can climb so high
aww yeah
and have everyone think i'm on the mend
you wanna run your fingers through mine
'cause there's nothing like seeing
it's the end of the film
up until the flood
but i still can't forget if i wanted to
you got me stuck on the thought of you
you're the only good i've ever done ever done
something stronger than i'm used to
now, did you notice me
holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
i'm not going to get too sentimental
that this was not your dream
come on, come on, come on, come on, come on and hey,
when i was young
their small-town eyes will gape at you
to all tomorrow's parties
all around the world all around the world they're no different than us
but he can kick like a mule, it's a real mean team
don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way
it's just
i said high
you good to go?
check it how i rock it.
search your heart, search your soul
and do anything to hear you say, "i'm yours"
so honey hold my hand, you like making me wait for it
and there's nothin' left here to remind me, just the memory of your face
i'm underloved, i'm underfed
to catch me now
baby, i miss you and i swear i'm gonna change, trust me.
tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
ah, come down, come down, brown sugar
but i need a good girl, i need someone to ground me
rosanna's down in texarkana
do you, mr. jones?
nah, nah, nah
and then i know just when to dream
got the thrill, it's sickening
i can see the evil, i can tell it i know when it's illegal
just because i wander 'round the places we would go
it hurts me every time i see you
well i would send them but i know
more than anyone's ever been
we breathe in the air of this small town
the club isn't the best place to find a lover
blue is the colour of all that i wear
this is a level where we're losing track of time
out of work, i'm out of my head
and nothing but good times to show
it gets so hard in times like now to hold on
baby, i need your lovin'
and got so far
and i'm never gonna tell you everything i've gotta tell you
we'll make a scene about a man that's sad and lonely
let the music take control
so beautiful you're leaving me
my head's under water
my worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
come kiss me, silver and gold
almost persuaded to push my conscience aside
pushing up the ante
let's show them we are
it never rains in california
to tell you how i felt that day
and some would curse john sutter's mill...
oh, i might stop talking to people before i snap, snap, snap
thank the people not today
cannot run from darkness
feeling all the highs, feeling all the pain
blue heaven's hue,
but i gotta go away from this place
that nero fiddled while rome was burned
and i've been keeping all the
and i'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine
you can tell me when it's over over
i'll be on my own, no crew crew
i went to a whore
if u wanted me you would just say so
you know it's true you know it's true
'cause i'm just holding on for tonight
to have mc's coming out sounding so similar
now i heard a cryin' man
when i'm near the girl that i love best
and a gentle touch
you hold me harder till i forget
i said hey, what is this
loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
it was all part of the plan
'cause i'm so lonely
move so pretty you're all i see
with a neigh neigh here.
well he can dance he can dance, take a chance with a little
when their hearts are breaking
this loneliness inside, darling
cause if you think i was born yesterday
or samson, but i go further the length
got a fist of pure emotion
say i'm the only bee in your bonnet
in the twist of separation you excelled at being free
feel my tears as they dry
come on! come on!
memories bring back, memories bring back you
but still, i want it more, more, more
johny, johny,
define what's within
some shade of blues is there;
when you ask
i believe it hurts when we cry
but just like a dream that comes in the night
is it something wrong with me? oh
i sat with an ear close, just listening
so gimme a chance
test the freddie damn that's it
i must be dreamin'
people hearing without listening
like you already know that i'm the love of your life
so you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
ooh, girl, i like you, i do i do
last thing i remember i was
make friends down in alabama
that may be all i need
but i learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
black paint and ammo, got bodies like rambo
wake in the morning and step outside
and then you'll probably spend the night at
we're falling like the stars
and all i know is we're going home
i'm in love
that you would always be mine
only love can hurt
let it hit em, split em, did it now i'm rid of em, yeah.
you and i
you're the sunshine on my life
not that you knew me back then
i don't fall for boys like you i don't fall for
since i first met you baby,
to have no one around
when i say that i'm not missing you so bad
i'm the one for a "good time call"
so baby now
that her man is darned unkind!
in every little thing only time will tell
may be
happiness, and i guess
and were there more than twenty-four hours in a day
when i'm in your firmm embrace
someone tell me how
but inevitably you'll be back again
all night long all night, yeah, all night
no more, no more
and i'm not scared to say those words, with you, i'm safe
turn into something beautiful
had offers but don't know which one to take
you got me in a tight grip
it was a stormy night, you know, the kind where the lightnin' strike
wish she were dead, as she
and dubious integrity
when midnight comes around
we passed that before!
just to get it all out, what's in my head
you're the light in my deepest darkest hour
from the dark end of the street
carry the news bring him, ha-ha, here you go!
he's the most
they're all blues
so i cross my heart, and i hope to die
and watch space odyssey
i'm somebody you use, but never own
do you wanna be free, are you ready for me
like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
he'll not get mixed up no more!
i guess this is moving on
won't you let my darling know
you're right, my love, you're always right, my love, okay
louisville!
kiss me here, touch me there, hanky panky
i'm addicted to you
talk to me girl
here we go again
some would
"please bring me my wine"
and now that i'm without your kisses without you
by transcendental meditation
you just need to either
until the poets run out of rhyme
just so i can get closer to you inside my dreams
that's that shit that's never getting bounced on ya
wastin' all of my time on livin' my fantasies
and i say yes i feel wonderful tonight
but it's too late now
know that we'll still have each other
is all i want too much to ask?
all that's left is a band of gold
and take a walk as the kane start to talk, 'cause
dropping on you
and brand new car
anything can work if you work it when people say you don't deserve it
down, down, down, down, down
let's move before they raise the parking rate
so take a look at me now, oh there's just an empty space
and the feeling that i'm under
boogaloo dudes i want to kick you!
one eye is taken for an eye
it's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
practice makes perfect
and so i'm sailing through the sea
when you find me there you'll search no more
i said hey what's going on
all your perfect imperfections
all hues,
i want to make it with you
they keep me thinking that we almost had it all
and gather 'round me children if you're willin'
i wanna feel you in my arms again
you're beautiful, beautiful
the capital are-a now take it to the g-e.
cause i honestly believed in you
i'd like to dedicate this to all the creative, righteous children
oh my god do i try
the night was long, the night went on, people coolin' out until the
and i play him all my sad, sad songs
can change my mind
and she showed me his calling card
cause i've been working hard to fade your memory
money, i choose
harry, you're no good alone
i wear
fought single-handed through the injun war
boy gonna miss me boy you are dismissed
he makes me feel so fine
you were only waiting for this moment to arise
i can't believe what god has done
i guess that now it's time for me to give up
please don't leave me, girl don't you go
this could be heaven or this could be
watermelon sugar sugar
what are you hearing?
i have a blue house
modern loneliness we love to get high
and allison's in galveston
but your pockets sure look empty
can't stand still
there's too much confusion
your mind is not your own
there ain't no cure for love
so why you tryin' to fake your love on the regular
but i'm never gonna make it without you
oh, yeah-yeah-yeah
doesn't mean that you're still on my mind
i let myself go
they tried to make me go to rehab
so i'm saving all my love
leave you when the summer comes a-rollin'
hmm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
got to have all your lovin'
point ya where ya goin'
i will never turn it in
do i still wish that it was you
i'll tell you why
i need to be with myself and center
about you
i hope that you see this through
i got my head out the sunroof
fill up your bag and i fill up a plate
when you only wanna do me dirty
on down that mississippi
i wait for night time to come
i've been tryna call
incidentally this record's available in the foyer always look on the right side of life
and it seemed everlasting
of the days when we were young, uh
got on board a westbound
sweeter than cinamon
but when we lay in bed
'cause all of me
do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
and i know i've said it a million times oh, i've said it a million times
i'm going through withdrawals
now listen to the beat
well, i've said it now, nothing's changed
i see them in the airport lounge
throw your soul through every open door whoa
hi
i'm fallin' in too deep oh
i'll keep you satisfied
to illustrate my last remark
you used to hold him right in your hand.
give yourself a chance
don't let her slip, don't let her slide
lot took his wife down to the cornerstore for a malted
well they came from new
something romantic

who gave you eyes like that
now i'm a brilliant mistake
but you see light in all i do
made a move, could've made a move
and i've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
five, six, seven, eight
you took my heart off my sleeve a decoration
i can't wait another day, amanda
just like i did
still feel, eighteen, but i'm burnt out
and the archer split the tree
i was lyin' in a burned-out basement
that i need someone to save me
i need something "you proof"
celine, my shoes

said no more counting
you answer all the puzzles in my heart
i took a sip from my devil's cup
with all her friends around
was a time
whenever i'm wrong, i'll tell you
oh, oh, oh, yeah, whoa
and i feel the cool night breeze
baby, when you take my hand
it'd be so beautiful if that came true
so natural that you want to go to war
singing someday it'll bring me back to you,
or define you or confine you
every woman child and man
baby, just to wake up with you
and when you come close i just tremble
dress me up, make it tight, i'm your dolly
and make romance romance baby, cause he's a looker
the way it was
in my mind
a glimpse of us
i can see the boats in the harbor way across the harbor
we really got to ramble
you want the girl with the small waist
of your hands never had met me
and i'll never be her
bless you all and keep you all on the land or on the sea
if i got it then you know you got it, heaven, i can reach you
knockin' at dixie's door!
she wears high heels
and back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
his wife then draped herself in black
everytime i close my eyes
i let go of everything
see the rhythm all in their feet
and i'll be waking up
as the world
did you check on me did you check on me
was the best that we found
doesn't mean i love you anymore anymore, anymore
me and my lady, we go steppin' we go steppin'
it will always follow you
alls my life i has to fight, nigga
tell the world i know it's too late
'cause it's gettin' me high
if i had it my way
let your friends laugh, even this i can stand
there's no escape, i can't wait
the world was younger than today
here it is another weekend and i ain't got nobody
if you come over
it's getting late to give you up
the way you are
i thought i heard them say
your lies seem true
i'm the one who
under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh
wouldn't you know
if i ain't got you with me baby oh ooh
you only love me when we're freaking
and i wanna go home
and what we see is no surprise
now everybody asks me why i'm smiling out from ear to ear
that cure for love
then she came and sat down at my table
if you could see that i'm the one
disturb the sound of silence
just want you
she forgot i hung the moon
i'm coming back home
thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox they
rudeboy, check out the goons
with some indie record that's much cooler than mine
for those that try to punk me, here's a pamprin child.
i figured out this story oh, no
hoping soon

that's breaking your back
you filled my heart with a kiss
you are exactly what i want, kinda cool and kinda not
and you make me so mad, i ask myself
my friends say i'm actin' wild as a bug
i need a lover to keep me sane
the valentines i never knew
the time
how long it takes
i'm always tired but never of you
sometimes i hate every single stupid word you say
cause you know it's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
i said baby, you know i'm gonna leave you
baby, i know she creepin', i feel it in the air
oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors
any way the wind blows
really reaching out for the other side
brand new nigga with the same old team
to all you heavy rounders with a headache for your pains
and i know your favorite songs
he doesn't mind, so then
when everything gets in the way
i like you, i do i do
mom read me a tale where
the party people say, damn, that rapper's great
yeah, once you get started you can't sit down
your bracelets and your brush
and i pray
how come, how come... woah!
picking up his sister, he makes his way to see-saw land
and even though i tried, it all fell apart
to love, love, yeah
if you say she's nothing to worry about
whoa
as i paced back and forth all this time
sink in the river the
she's a busted valentine
did you hear my covert narcissism
let go on the wheel, it's the bullet lane
do do doop
and i'm leaving out the whistles and bells
we went to bed in france, then we woke up in japan
i just gotta feelin' that we might be friends for a long, long time
the reflection of my wedding band
you know i lost a lot of friends there baby
i just wanna know you better know you better know you better now
you'll be right and understood
kinda mad that i didn't take a stab at it
without my baby, where are you now when i need you most?
you said you wouldn't and you fucking did
used to tell me, "sky's the limit", now the sky's our point of view view
looking for adventure
cameras point and shoot shoot
i think i'm ready now, i think i'm ready now
all around the world
love your curves and all your edges
well, barbie, we're just getting started
and for you, girl, i swear i'll do the worst
but things just get so crazy
and i'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
and gamma rayed your function
the falling leaves drift by the window
must have been a deadly kiss
you're right, now i know what is love and what is life
nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time
take my arms that i might reach you."
something to make my heart beat the faster.
i can't resist this sweet surrender
breathe me out
you take up every corner of my mind
hmm we keep this love in a photograph
i'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
it lingered in the air
as we're getting old
as they tried to cross the
forget about your sin
i'm dying to see how this one ends
so i know we got issues baby true, true, true,
every time you touch me i just melt away
you wouldn't even recognize me anymore
you'll always be apart of me
you're very well-read, it's well-known
a hound in the distance is starting to bey
memories follow me left and right
when you're drunk with your friends at a party
or send you a bouquet, saying, "it's a mistake"
you were always on my mind
love to just get into some of your stories
at the same time, i wanna hug you
making me you love you
i keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
give my last hello, hope it's worth it
always look on the light side of life
i just wanna see how beautiful you are
your cadillac has got a wheel in the ditch
oh, her mother's blood'll curdle
what can you do for me?
just starting to crawl
you know how to just make me want
the family gathers 'round and reads it
long as we got each other hey
maybe sometime later you might swim back into shore
i watched you die i watched you die
if your heart, never could yield to me
i wasted it all just to watch you go
and trust me i'll give it a chance now
yeah, got to, got to bleed, baby
just one hit of you, i knew i'll never be the same
abusing my power full of resentment
images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
and the dream of what love could be
cause sometimes i look in her eyes
i see through sweet little lies and every excuse
she's a real sad tomato
you want to go for a ride?
maybe i didn't hold you
she found out they were not hers!
comes out just when you need it to
that'll work, come over
i've got a million emotions
what's standing in front of me
well, it's nothing 'til i give it to you
but i'm over you
i think i left my conscience on your front door step
there she stood in the doorway
i'm fine baby, how are you?
so i'm saving all my love for you
hearts were never broken
and now it's goodbye, it's goodbye for us
now, i'm crying in my room
but i wanna go home, mmm
there's people around who tell you that they know
hearts are never broken
another winter day
well, billy rapped all night about his suicide
you and i go hard
charlie shuffler on the beat
i could treat you better
don't tell 'em how you found me
how i'm thankful for the life we've made
i think that you are the one for me
i guess i'm all messed up now baby
i've been looking at the sky
but now i'm all fucked up out in la
staring blankly ahead, just making my way
we're not lovers
just like i told you before, before, before
i had to go make that fund and i'm trying to be great at something
finally you put my love
but nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out
that's when i feel in love
i really think that we could make it girl
now that i see what our end is
look in to your heart, you will find
then weak i'd rather be
girl, i felt your heart beatin' heavy for me woah
but how could i hate her
he got mixed up with a maisie
she said that she was working for the abc news
cupid is so dumb
some would fail and some would prosper
oh what a way to go
you put my love on top top top top top
oh i'm in love
put a flame to every single word you ever said
you know it's gonna be
i kick lyrics so dope that the brothers call em head spinners.
you're beautiful, beautiful, you should know it
with a ass from tennessee
when the people there said
don't mess with mr. in-between
and all my
over what went down on the plains of abraham.
and i let it burn
in these eyes tellin' you?
movin' around, come on, movin' around
in the darkness of my lonely room
you can't be reasoned with, i'm done being polite
i could use some tape, i could use some glue
well, you walk into the room like a camel, and then you frown
'cause i'd already know
and i think you should be somethin'
and i can't help recalling how it felt to kiss and hold you tight
i can make your dreams come true come true
happy to be near you
lord knows, twenty of 'em in my chevy
tie- tie the rope
'cause the second i figure it out he pushes me away
beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me,
this is a big world, that was a small town
she gon' do it all for me when them bands come
i never learn, i never learn
fifteen dozen roses
and if my daddy thinks i'm fine
ooh, baby
i might not have a fancy car
i got it good, now let me tell you who i am
oh, my, my, my, my, my, my babe
have been the greatest moments of my life
yeah, i wanna take you with me
yeah, gold coast slave ship bound for cotton fields
put my love on top
or leave me standing in the rain
and they came here at
so when you hear a def rhyme, believe that i'm the author
usually i would never, would never even care
i haven't seen it in a while
i used to call my mom every sunday
don't mess or test your highness
said i don't understand it baby
ooh darlin' 'cause you'll always be my baby
otherwise otherwise, pandemonium
boy wanna date me boy outta date yeah
and he, he get me prada, get me miu miu like rihanna ah
to the place i was before
it don't matter at all where you've played before.
people writing songs that voices never share
meeting someone serious
there's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
'cause i love the way you love me
i have a hoe
you had to fight to have the upper hand
i'll wait for you i promise you i will
he's ahead of us all, meetin' the test
before i met you baby,
spend those euro-dollars
and we'll see it through
no other woman is gonna love you more
the scars of your love never had met me
oh, ain't that nice?
da, da, da, da
too high, can't come down
how long do you think that i can wait
since
i don't think about it, i deposit every other zero
too great for our hearts
my soul flies free like a willow tree
everybody come on!
lookin' like an angel, but your savage love
read 'em and weep
all things dull and ugly,
imma keep it real and bust up on the snakes
that trembles on the brink of a lovely song.
so quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down
time has brought your heart to me
ooh, and i wished you would hurt me harder than i hurt you
i can make all the tables turn
i never wanna die
what you think i'm paid for nothing?
i can hear it callin' me back home
i will not break the way you did
huh? we gon' be alright
no reason to get excited
i'm so in my head
and think about it
you get what you give and give what you get, so
if you forgot i got it, i'll remind you
but you stayed out, stayed out at night
so don't feed me planned obsolescence
no one else but you
i want you, in my arms
how to erase your body from out my brain
i was her only one
tell everybody i'm on my way
when i need you everything stops
i'll be needing stitches and i'll be needing stitches
i heard the news baby
but i refuse to let you go
hurry up now, i need a miracle
so let us stop talkin' falsely now
hit pch, 180
and the land was plowed and tamed
you've got a soul and everybody knows
and i... am feeling so small
got to race some cat to bed
no spoiler please
if i quit calling you my lover
just can't help it, there's nothing i want more
and i'm on my way
the lyric utilizer
lemme show you how it feel like
when it gets hard you know it can get hard sometimes
i know i laughed when you left
the motor's runnin' on trucker's blood
everything i do
whenever you go out
found a piece of shining gold
the originator, and boy do i hate a perpetrator
but i still want that
i thought the perfect guy would come and find me
c'mon brian, cheer up
you keep playing, not another day with you shorty
she only made it two days, what a connection
no more crying
you're the coffee that i need in the morning
that the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
so then i took my turn
four years, no call
i see you beggin' on your knees
the thief, he kindly spoke
i walk along the city streets you used to walk along with me
i'll be there in a heartbeat
you can't sleep, you can't eat
is i know something now
just one hit of you, i knew i'll never be the same i'll never be the...
i feel you touch me in the pouring rain
screaming crying perfect storms
on the day we fell in love
in the back of my mind making me feel like
i can't give you anything but love, baby
at seventeen
when you start every fight, the blame is on you
'cause every morning i find you oh
can't believe that i haven't figured out by now
left that stone in the river bed.
just one request from the radio
and i thought, "wow, if i could take this in a shot right now
he made their brutish venom.
there ain't no drink no drug
you brought me peace of mind and thats why
when i start to feel, i unattach
i said hey, what's your name baby
i walked in the room,
it's heavy, then set it
now i've gotta love so deep, in the pit of my heart
the end, the end, the end, the end
i'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
my style of rhyme covers you like calamine lotion
mammy!
loving you is wonderful
well, boy, i don't give a fuck
but i don't call soft enough
i heard you cry
hi, ken
i hate that i love you
they don't know how long it
wait a minute, wait a minute, we was just getting started
maybe baby you think these tears i cry are tears of joy
come, come on now, follow my lead
when it comes to the lyrics i gets busy with mine.
everything involved is shady
and i know just how to lie
the doctors working day and night
but i've got to get a move on with my life
i've been on my own for long enough
can you be my friend
i'm taken back to two thousand and two
come on, come on, come on, come on,
you talk all that sweet talk, but i ain't comin' back
throw away the work to be done
wake you up in the middle of the night
now you're tryin' to trick me in love
walks by
nothing really matters, anyone can see,
resentment that turned into a deep depression
i'm just thinking out loud
we had kin livin',
hearing you whisper through the phone
in the morning you were out of my sight
never meant to cross you
let me know when you free
you are the promised kiss of springtime
racing with the wind
my aim is true.
i need to tell you something
so put your money on the bread winner.
and all her boyfriends were sweet 16
you can't tell me it's not worth dying for
in this, this stupid war
truly the angel's best
and i can't sweep you off of your feet
why, oh why do you want to do me this way
i wanna go out dancing
till today
when you should be with me instead?
cause i know you wanna ask
nothing you can sing that can't be sung
you and me are thrifty so go all you can eat
but all i think about
and i don't think the world is sold
i see through your crews like an x-ray tube
uh, can i bite your tongue like my bad habit
i used to not take chances with god's name
all apologies
comin' down like dow jones
and all i've seen
one day i'll watch as you're leaving and life will lose all its meaning
and a cool, and a cool, and a cool, and a cool, cool night
and then we start to dance and now i'm singing like
to all that jazz?
and when you smile
well, i'm too busy for your business
they don't understand
i believe in love, alfie
but i won't go, go, go
been here all along
plowmen dig my earth
doesn't mean i love you anymore anymore anymore
what kind of pills are you on"
through my open ears inciting and inviting me
nothing really matters,
wishing on dandelions all of the time
then i looked into her eyes and i saw it
and the memories of what love could be
i'll be your best friend, and you'll be mine valentine
'cause in the stratosphere, how could he lend an ear
as the ones who gave me my last name
i wish we had one more kiss
one, two, three, one, two, three, drink
now imagine it, put the hours in and stay passionate
love my friends to death
baby, bring it to me
if life is a movie
and it's an awful mess
none will level on the line
’cause we argue all the time
you'll hear the music fill the air
in the middle of the night
we're on the ground, we're screaming
i wait in the darkness of my lonely room
watching every move on her face
every time i call you up
cause i don't know if you've been loving somebody.
i know that i'll be fine
done fell through
don't forget, you're the one that tried to get with my friends
and you say, "what does this mean?" and he screams back, "you're a cow!
who's up next to pull to a fast one
then i'll know that you will plainly see
you're the only good i've ever done ever done, oh, yeah
to bring you to me
more than
you'll never know, dear,
drop some money
i stopped an old man along the way
acadian driftwood,
she'd turn the rain to a rainbow
rappers stepping to me, they want to get some
but i won't go, go, go!
and so i cry sometimes when i'm lying in bed
we're nothing more than friends
which stood on rocky shores
that love isn't real
and our homes were taken
taste of your lips, i'm on a ride
and so i wake in the morning and i step outside
well you must be going crazy thinking i'll be back i'm sorry
ain't nothin' goin' on but the rent
there's not another who could take your place
all the kiss i miss kissing.
if you're determined to leave boy
she goes up while he goes down
i'm getting stronger, i'm getting stronger
nothing really matters to me
talk about your lovers and your fighters
but guns they wait to be stuck by, at my side is god
'cause you're my iron man
you got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
and a love so deep we cannot measure
what are you doing alabama?
since knowledge is infinite
i wrote a song for you
i can't
in debentures of quality
say you'll never let me go
your skin oh yeah your skin and bones
am i lying to myself again
you're part of my entity, here for infinity
blue sky
in case you go and leave me in the dirt
and to you i just keep crawling
down down down down down
sometimes i feel so insecure
switch sides and i'm beside ya
now try and shade me, i'm like i guess
said don't let me down
did he leave your pretty fingers lying
try to leave your text unread
oh, come on
last night you were in my room
but i heard you let that little friend of mine
we're sure to find
down like fertilizer
something even non-believers can believe in
but i know it don't come in a shot glass
every day of my life
competition, i just devour like a pitbull against a chihuahua
oh, where has she gone to? oh, where can she be?
anymore
i don't wanna wait my whole life through
oh me oh my
no, it's never been better
i go there each night
you got to have somethin' if you wanna be with me
and if i fell under the spell of your call
about leaving, leaving me behind
you said it looked better
boy i like you just the way you are
all we had was gone
all around the world they're no different than us
with you i'll always share
spend how i like it
and all along i believed i would find you
all i know is a simple name
and the wind began to howl, hey
that walk around
don't need to talk about love
what a weasel
and making love was just for fun
the baggage in my heart is still so dark
rest assured i feel the same way you do
and it brings me back to you
i gave my all and they all know it
you start my heart a jumpin'
steal some covers, share some skin
i need this feelin'
you love me now and i feel the same way
give me what the hell i want
might win an oscar you can't never tell
you won't love me back, no,
find out what it is all about
i needed someone
then don't give in, 'cause hate may win some battles, but love wins in the end
darling, don't be afraid, i have loved you for a thousand years
now i know why you love me
don't be silly chumps
from now until tomorrow
a fly girl like me needs security
i can't seem to stand on my own two feet
'cause i know i can treat you better than he can
women back down and bow down to my motherfucking homegirl.
and i say
they're a little older,
i know you've noticed me too
i wanna see you lose control."
i just want you, i just want you
now hang up on the noose
i'd be fired if that were my job
yeah, we're driving down the freeway at night
there's nothing pure enough to be a cure for love
it's always been inside of you, you, you
and i know the ways to fame
too late now
it's raining, raining
bismillah! no, we will not let you go
get with the uh, roughest, roughest. yeah
hey, got to, got to bleed baby
sipping on your lips, hanging on by a thread, baby
your heart sweats, your body shakes
i rock on with my bad self cause it's a must.
eat, sleep, and breathe it
well, uh, outside in the cold distance
and you may not think
till one night she clipped him for all his hair
is how you annoy me daily
la, da, da, da, da, da
under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
then said you were wrong for me
when you want to step to me, i think you should know that
as sure as i believe there's a heaven above, alfie
i need to see you naked
no spoilers please
at least that's what people say
i know she'll be leavin' with me
all the young dudes hey, dudes!
you made plans and i, i made problems
i'm on my way
hear that fella yellin', "alabam!".
watch the sun rise
oh, i might stop talking to people before i snap
but i hope i never see them again
bring gloom down to the minimum
freddie ain't no phony
some stayed on,
why i'm still here, or where could i go
take me as i am take my life
some people want diamond rings
when skies are grey, even when they're blue
and kept the beaches shipwreck free
oh, moon of alabama
looks like we're in for nasty weather
save your tears
yeah, i always had to be right
come on!
when you know you're always late
maybe it's all part of a plan
would be everything i need and this could be so different
and happiness
i rap, i black on track so rest assured
fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
'cause i wanna keep you, any way i can
everything look better with a view
i need to make sure you know that
of that mattress that you stole
i want to be the one you seek in the morning
but i don't want nothing at all
isn't she precious
i'm thinking out loud
then i could fill the world with all my
and i'll be yours yours until two and two is three
for all this
but how can love go through pain
i'm in an awful way everybody sing
but shit that wouldn't solve them
and i've been tryna fill all of this empty
to feel this way?
it's just 'til these tears have dried
each nasty little hornet,
time and again i've longed for adventure,
that his injun friends could keep their land
i'm a leo you're a cancer
anything you ever dreamed
no matter what you do
and oil company faces are grinnin'
and i thought i heard you call my name
can't do crowds not our scene
and now i wonder
'cause all i know is we said hello
now he's dead
blurring all the lines, you intoxicate me
and i hope that we keep falling
say boy let's not talk too much
this could be all that we know of love and all
if we go dutch, you can still touch my love, it's free
you wanna run it up, i wanna lock it down
about nothing and everything all at once?
baby, you're the one that i need
i drink too much and that's an issue, but i'm okay
you tore me down and now it's showing
cause i'm in a field of dandelions

i think it must be love i love you
take that money watch it burn
she'll wear a tight mini black dress

fightin' for my life, i couldn't breathe again
and the accent on the positive
hey, hey baby, hey, hey baby
yeah, everyone know what i mean, mean
i'm blue
but the grass ain't always greener on the other side,
today i think i want a phantom
make love, anythin' to sate ya
mirrors on the ceiling
desperately remained at home

that i wrote to you
but maybe it’s for the best

for 'tis love, and love alone, that can repay!
away from where i stand

his silky hair was brown

nowhere to turn no

the pleasure is to play
no way you're never gonna change me
if you say it's alright
but, uh, but you and i, we've been through that
i see a little silhouetto of a man,
where the gin is cold but the piano's hot
what's it all about, alfie?
come on i'm in love with your body, be my baby, come on
got a feelin' most would treasure
two, don't let him in
to the motherland
boys and girls, i think i've gone cray

we're higher and higher
sweet eileen's in abilene
when you look at it
so every lonely night, i sing this song
you know i dealt with you the nicest
i'm in an awful way
haven't i made it obvious haven't i made it
can't you find a little room inside for me can't you find, for me
or with a nasty scar leave a nasty scar
all the young dudes now you bring him down, 'cause i want him!
a wildcat did growl
in the thick of healing, yeah
so please don't let me go
i bet your mama was a tent show queen
bless you all and keep you with the faith to let it pass
you think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
but i keep cruising
finally, you put my love on top
no need to say mo', check the flow.
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
carry the news i want you!
i remembered you was conflicted
i'm lucky i know
and if you think that i'm still holdin' on to somethin'
isn't she wonderful
i feel it's time
but shouldn't that be enough for me?
she hates, but i think it's so sexy
now freddie end the game end the game
maybe it's the way you play your game
for temptation was flowing like wine
'cause you're crying like a baby but do i look like your mommy
just to hear them say
here another saturday night and i ain't got nobody
loves me better makes me feel this way
but it's so good, i've never dreamed of nobody like you
three, don't be his friend
therefore i reside in tennessee
that's how it's got to feel
we're just friends
the holy books are open wide
exceeds accounts received
they're a moan of pain
it's okay, don't be alarmed
beat on, cheat on, mistreat you
our love will never end, no
needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead wind up dead
i wonder, i wonder what she's thinking of
now i don't want to meet your kin
always something there to remind me
'cause girl, you're amazing
you must be mistaken someone
said, "pity, please, the ones who serve
end it now and pay the due
and if our love was a story book
i know it breaks your heart
reality, my secret technique
i believe that you and me last forever
rock 'n' roll
and my heart changed
yeah, i'm a dude, dad
i'ma leave my autograph
place your head on my beating heart
'cause there is always something there to remind me
and those whose names were never called
i tell myself
met a girl with a drink in her hand
dreaming about the things that we could be
can't hide the truth, i stayed with her in spite of you
my luck is changing it's gotten from simply roten
but then i get so numb with all the laughter
the stars and the sun, but still, i'm not enough
watch it falling for me, i love the way that feels
i put my title in your face, dare you to base
this feeling that i know so well
lacking in the social graces
cause i care more about what other people say
and i had a feverish dream
in paris and rome
broke down and busted
but i'm holding on for dear life
baby sometimes, sometimes we don't know why
my money rules
i turned my collar to the cold and damp
when i was young and naive
it pours, man, it pours
always had to put yourself above me
head out on the highway
busy as a beaver, ya best believer.
and how you don't know how to keep your business clean
i tell you, i tell you
i dont know why yeah
i said, ooh, i'm blinded by the lights
can you please just go away?
so now i can't stop thinking about you
since i first met you baby, never knew what i was missing
maybe we found love right where we are
i tell you we must die
that's how you fucking spell "friends"
new money, suit and tie
it's been rumored that i died
well, i got
and somebody points to you and says, "it's his"
"you better keep movin' on"
what have you lost? nothing
but ain't shit new to a freak
true love, it must be true love
so my karma come in heaven, no preliminary hearings on my record
cause he ain't got nobody to listen to
can you feel it?
so you can keep me
i've been drinking more alcohol
they never even liked you in the first place
what will you lend on an old golden rule?
well, i'm back, back
open your mouth
who do you thank when you have such luck?
and i say yes you look wonderful tonight
i can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle
prettiest town i've ever seen
i hope this night will last forever
cause i want this to be something
thirty-thousand wheels are spinnin'
deny, defy, mystify you
you're right, only me and you, that would be nice
she grows up for another man, and he's down
i swear to god i can see
just like a young girl should
my apple tree
old wilf carter 78s
no you don't know me well
oh i remember you driving to my house
and it drives me insane
darling don't be afraid
but now i'm in pieces, barely believing
that's okay, baby, only words bleed
come on babe, we're gonna brush the sky
if you love me won't you
find my nest of salt
all evil great and small,
you've been through all of f. scott fitzgerald's books
say you drive a ford
you know it's not the same as it was
i forget just why i left you, i was insane
yes, only by dying will tell, yeah
show me the way
watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
whatcha gon' do now
just like a young girl should, ah yeah
the way you love every part
all this time how could you not know baby
well i once knew love
but it's so good, i've never known anybody like you
how i wish i had some someone to talk to
then you
all i know is you held the door
set fire to my purpose
i wear sneakers
life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
i only know it isn't mine.
but i'm thinking of
bless you all and keep you on the road to tenderness
i can't believe it
you know that i see it
ooh, we called it off again last night
and through the glass the corn crows come like rain
when i'm away, i will remember how you kissed me
all night long all night, all night, all night
they'll say that i was clever
and she said, 'we are all just prisoners here
baby, i ain't playing by your rules
'cause ain't nothin' goin' on but the rent
i feel the love, feel the love
all around the chosen ones
but oh, i love my life
tell me a secret
kilt him a bar when he was only three
that lives in a blue world
i'm in love with your body
looking back on my life
cause i'm not your princess, this ain't a fairy tale
don't you know that you're toxic?
that you are not impressed.
a yes i'll give you love
and she makes me glad that i'm a man
going out of my mind
but i said no, no, no
i'm fallin' in too deep, oh
makes me feel this way
d-don't let me down
us, trust...
i'm really gonna miss you picking fights
talkin' 'bout the sea and the sky
the sea, the sky
up from new orleans
you just gotta ignite the light
how could i ever compete with that
is that now i'm alone
'cause when i'm with you i need no air
if nobody's perfect
how many more shots until you're rolling
or the moon, i consume the room with doom.
whenever i'm wrong, just tell me the song
just one hit of you, i knew i'll never ever, ever be the same
but i guess that dream wasn't meant to be like
i'll give them all my money
and if you don't want to be down with me, you just don't want to be down
and i can't believe that time is
the fire burning in my eyes
i'm lucky we're in love in every way
another victory, they can't get with me
alls my life i
but now my rhymes open brims a spirituality
already told you we're done, what didn't you get?
breaking us down
loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
magic, madness, heaven, sin
but you'll still be my star
praying to god that one day you'll be mine
that makes the lonely winter seem long.
with just one glance he's sweet talking and cool
look out children, here he come
when there is always something there to remind me
carry the news there you go!
and still those voices are calling from far away
look at mother nature on the run in the nineteen seventies
many, they'll do it every time
tryna get out of the pain, know that i've come so far
no way you're never gonna stray me
all the gold in california
instrumental
boogaloo dudes i want you at the front!
i'll be your platinum, i'll be your silver, i'll be your gold
yes, i'm back in black
take a look at me now
and i finally able to breathe
boy, gonna diss me? boy, i'm so pissed
the thing that i feel is stronger than love believe me
dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
don't tell
you know me you know me
i'm gonna swing from the chandelier
all the sudden, i'm hypnotized
pack it all away, pack it all in one suitcase
the indo blow and the grass grow.
there's no one quite like you, you push all my buttons down
it's the best band in the land
hold me close don't ever let me go
feelings deep inside yeah cannot suppress it
and for all the in-between years, come what may
something that you've never seen
take me as i am, take my life
with no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me
or get with the man with the given gift of gab
everybody ain't got it, understand, son, yeah
in the session with the lesson
and you say, "for what reason?" and he says, "how"
so i'm snapping one, two
and you say, "impossible!" as he hands you a bone
so, please be true, don't fuck around with me
i can't get no relief
but everything gon' be alright
is it too late to pursue
so the room must listen to me
my heart can't possibly break
i've gotta follow it 'cause everything i know
old friends will meet us
i'll stop time for you
and my brother's back at home with his beatles and his stones
and i feel just like
i speak clearly so you can understand
don't you think that love can last
now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar
you could call it an omen
keep my glass full until morning light
nun gamgo pop pop an bwado cheok
toast to the ones here today
do you miss the road that you grew up on
we can go line for line
i just found out, the only reason that you lovin' me
running for the door
i'll tap that butt, wax the cuts, pass the bucks.
snake eyes watching you
the beautiful kind
dark nights in my prayers
and some would curse john sutter's mill
i think i'm ready now
put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,
what a way to ride,
my momma shoulda named me grace cause i'm amazingly
see the sky, you and i
you've gotta ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
but i'd rather work on this with you
summer or winter, ? and spring
we now, must say goodbye
how i tried, how i tried to be great for you
my rhymes are so dope and the rappers be hoping
all i have is myself at the end of the day
and watch this lovin' feeling disappear
i'm taking my misery
we'll have one on each knee
and i need you to hold me tight
just let me go naturally
before we were steady
just because i wander
but if god got us then we gon' be alright
every morning, every evening
yeah we got a lot of love but it don’t make sense
they tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe
won't look down, won't open my eyes
who made the sharks? he did!
then all that i want is to be imperfect with you
fakers gonna fake
neath the halo of a streetlamp
i think i'm losing my mind
yes, i'm saving all my love for you
you and i go rough
what did i do to deserve someone to hold me like you do?
and talk in the past and not the present tense
acepto mis errores, también soy humano
they were worth it all along, yeah
when you see me smiling, you know
somehow lost her sanity
and your skin oh yeah your skin and bones
doubting myself again, can't find a light in the dark
but hey now hey now, you know, girl know girl,
so honey now
ooh wee, ooh wee, oh wee
is not the
and you make me so mad i ask myself
oh, baby
don't you share your smile with anyone else but me
hmmm, oh
eyes are red and i don't smoke banga
but how can love last through tears
yes i've been black, but when i come back
that someday it would lead me back to you
to finish what they started
another fella told me he had a sister who looked just fine
they call and say, "come dance with me"
i say your name, but you're not around
so i went runnin' for answers
i lose my way
like him inside and outside
and when they ask me, "who could ask for more?"
that what you're looking for has been here the whole time
in abilene, my abilene
why don't you take the day off and try to repair?
oh, life is too serious, love's too mysterious
late night, watching television
and you ask me why i like to play
oh, it's too late
carry the news let's hear the news, come on!
'cause if you like the way you look that much
if i tell you tonight, would you turn out the lights
i feel like no one could feel
she promised to honor, to love, and obey
now that you're gone
you really fucked me up
oh i miss you you know
now i'm getting colder
living life gets hard to do
up and down the line
and i sing in the car
girl, you're amazing
yeah, so you can cut me up and kiss me harder
i do it for you
each beastly little squid
to wake up everyday, knowing i am loved by you
you know everyone is talkin' on the scene
sometimes i wanna slap you in your whole face whoa oh oh
i hear the drums echoing tonight
you pull me close
hopeless girl is seeking someone
i said, why oh why do you want to do me this way
and i'll never ever make you cry
is the ace of spades
no insurance could she find!
i see bad times today
needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head gotta get you outta my head
and boy your lips taste like a night of champagne
ain't nobody
hear the banjo
do like i do
a few stolen moments is all that we share
you don't mind if you do
i swear i was in the back seat, just minding my own
when i had nothin' to say you couldn't take it
things aren't the way they were before
any smile you might see
so alone in love like the world had disappeared
we both know it's a cruel world
but baby i've been i've been praying hard
my life is not a game
say you're sorry
bad trips like, yah!
but i'll take
i'm blasting our favorite tunes
the next thing i felt was you
and then you change your mind
you've got your family and they need you there
for whom none will go mourning
high voltage rock 'n' roll
about the eliminatin' of the negative
you got the cutest baby face
where all them folks goin to the st. louis cemetery meet
don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow
stay and play that blink-182 song
but everything means nothing
oh!
saying i love you
go ahead and sell me out and i'll lay your ship bare
you're running at a different speed
i can hear, i can hear them echoing
you only call me on the, you only call me on the weekend
they didn't give a damn.
in somebody else's name.
the autumn leaves of red and gold
man now we stepping out like, "whoa" oh god
that's why i'm askin' you what can you do for me
each other again
up to the man, up to the man
nigga, we gon' be alright
and the boats go by
just livin' all night for it, lay it all down
if i ain't got you with me, baby, oh, ooh
oh, alabama
i wanna smash your fears
i see you in the subway and i see you on the bus
lord, don't she make me smile
no romance without finance
lucky to be coming home again
tonight, we smoke them out
filled with ill-contempt
why begin then cry for something that might have been?
ordered rings, cars and furs
spread out my wings, i'm a fly, fly high
don't need you here anymore need you here anymore
and make up the same day, same day
doin' somethin' unholy unholy
non-stopping the groove, until when it's the climax
how deep is your love,
i stay out too late
you and i get so damn dysfunctional we stop keeping score
all i do the whole day through is dream i'm dreaming, dreaming a dream
all can spend is just my time
ah! i know at last the secret of it all;
i'm waking up on my dream
knowing him, loving him
some people live just for the fame
old john sutter went to the mill side
holding me closer
i'm your girl
why does kissing this time mean you'll be gone
boogaloo dudes i want him right here, bring him, come on!
they try to make me go to rehab
and walk away knowin' i love you?
he said my life's a bore
my knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow
say, boy, let's not talk too much
the lord god made the lot.
just come back to the places where we used to go and i'll be there
modern loneliness, we love to get high
living alone
for the future and all
and i'll never get enough
kick in the door waving the coco
and you're the first to say you want the best thing
so i hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
my rights, my wrongs, i write 'til i'm right with god
yeah i've been sippin', i've been buzzing
you're probably on your flight back to your hometown
that's it
no matter how far
change the weather still together when it ends
yeah, she put it down slowly
loves me better ain't nobody, baby
baby, baby, it's you
i don't want to live forever
do you miss me like i miss you
funky little boat race
i'm so happy that you're mine
thug it out 'til we get it right
get drunk on the good life i'll take you to
yeah they were all yellow
put em up till they shut em down, yeah
a school of mcing, for those who want to be in
we made these memories for
it makes me feel so nice
any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to
that we beat to death in tucson, okay
house boy knows that he's doing alright
sing about here, everybody!
then i guess it is wise to be cruel
porque a tu lado me di cuenta que nada soy
we are never getting back together. like, ever"
now i am
so she knew her love wasn't far away
i should've known that it was dumb love
apple tree
another day, 'nother night
some pushed on to california
just breathe and live and let it die
i just keep on coming back to you
than to lean on me
there's something you've forgotten
i'm dreamin' my life away
and you'll find love any day, alfie
make a little birdhouse in your soul birdhouse in your soul
made me look like a fucking idiot at every party
i ain't got no money
she thinks i left them in the will
but i know i've gotta give it a try
he said, 'we haven't had that spirit here
this isn't my turn
and if one more person says, "you should get over it"
i went to a shrink
this time i won't break your heart, your heart, yeah
bluebird of friendliness
i have a girlfriend and she is so blue
but i'm alive and well in tennessee
off of one touch i could overdose
everybody dance like jimmy
come on, baby
wash it all down with that coors
and i think you should be somethin' i don't wanna hold back
getting washed away in you
i don't ever want to drink again
oh no oh no
if you like to gamble
oh, what a feeling
and everything would stay the same
i'm talking slick back, kick back, gang sippin' forties
you make me happy
i wish i could shelter the boy i knew
dumb stuff like chores when it's 20 below
hopeless girl is seeking
and there you are on your knees
but i can't stay mad when you walk like that, no
and there’s no chance
and you give me all of you
and every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
with you i can let down my guard
but it's the sweetest pain
could've had it all you're gonna wish you
i told them, i said to him, bernie, i said they'll never make their money back
but i keep on coming back to you
what would i do without your smart mouth?
all the time, all the way
i wish you don't
to every man who answers to the letter of the law
but i don't know how to leave you
when you could be blowin' up just like my cellular
i can make tonight forever
so gon' and let the rain pour
when i
a well i'll give you love
choking on the ashes of her enemy
lucky to be coming home someday
might as well face it
just like a moth drawn to a flame
it's green where you water it
but i hit right back
and when you want it, baby, i know i got you covered
some just rather say goodbye, bye
it's quite confusing for you to remember
and i know, i said it a million times
i just made a hundred bands
silence like a cancer grows
cause it's only you, nobody new, i put you first
and trick biatch, she's guaranteed to tear shit up.
the all seeing eye that recognize the rap clones
left my soul in his vision
and who was i to say
and any girl like you deserves a gentleman
oh, i repeat
they was crying for bread
picket white fence, but we paint it black
and there's nowhere else
won't you come to my arms sweet darlin' and stay
first thing we'd climb a tree
come on and show me how you do you do
how come you taste so good?
he's really down
all that i wanted from you was to give me something that i never had
and in the
and everything has changed
i'm not scared of dying
why do you say the things that you say
ooh baby
i, i don't
swing low, alabama
i'm still learning to love
why, why, why, why, why
though i've been trying hard against strong odds
i'd spend 10,000 hours and 10,000 more
you've got the cutest little
and let me know that it's not all in my mind
ooh, what fun
but i can't i just can't
and then she placed her soft hands in mine
not to put too fine a point on it
the scars of your love remind me of us
your eyes look like
and turn into a beacon burning endlessly bright
there she stood in the street
when i'm looking at you
boogaloo dudes stand up, come on!
had
you know, you come from nothing
slowly sinking to their rendezvous
in case you shake apart and want a brand new start
for all the times that you made me feel small
don't let him in, don't let him in
now i'm hittin mc's like hoo-yu-ken!
because i know that's weakness in your eyes
i seek to cure what's deep inside
if i woke up without ya, i don't know what i would do
nothing you can make that can't be made
we're on the right side of rock bottom
and when my pen hits the paper, ah shit
all your life
i work at pleasin' me
or were we wellprepared
that make you who you are
and when they've grown up
hard to be sure
you're goin' all about it in the worst ways
i cannot cry
say something, i'm giving up on you
and then bitch i'm all alone
singing "love is forever and ever"
or did we both give up
you put my love on top
it's 4 am
well, i dreamed i saw the knights in armor coming
i'd give it all just to hold you close
it has infinitely fell on me so um...
i just want you back for good
i'm all shook up
so i can chop into your body
to a new home
i found myself wanting to kiss her
forever's not enough time to oh
yeah, we are all we need
come and rest your bones with me
you're still in my heart
i really mean to learn
come along with me
doing something unholy
cause you made your bed, sleep in it
lyrical murderer, i'm servin em like two scoops of chocolate.
i guess he got lost or flew away
never been lonely
on a dark desert highway
he give his word and he give his hand
thoughts i never said
the days drag on
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
well, love was a country we couldn't defend
one day i'll watch as you're leaving
i remember the day
oh that'd be spent in sweet content, dreaming away
can you be my lover up until the very end
i can make all the
no one wants to stay at home
when you come knocking, i'll be at your door
when you're chewing on life's gristle
that maybe we found love right where we are, oh
i tried to treat you right
i could never get attached
i will not let anything take away
we hadn't seen each other in a month
and now it's time to let it through

i still can't believe that you're mine
baby baby it's you
even when i mean the most to you
et cetera, et cetera, it ain't easy being me
i don't think i could hide what i'm feelin' inside
i keep it a hundred, we one in a million, no billion
we're gonna 'cause talk and suspicion
we can share a life together
what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when
for you to beat me, it's gonna take a miracle
no way that you'll see me cry
in the twinkling of an eye
so i cross my heart, and i hope to die yeah
you should go and love yourself
time to set it straight, know what i'm saying
take my hand
emotion unlocking
but i'm still missing you

they had opened up the west.

i'm just a poor boy nobody loves me
what would you do
on for tonight, on for tonight
but they just can't kill the beast
'cause it's all right whoa it's all right
it feels good to have you back again
why do you rub me up the wrong way?
i will not let myself 'cause my heart so much misery
out of self respect, i'm out of bread
is half a man, with no sense of pride
girl, you know i want your love
and listen to our thoughts
just hear that choo-choo sound,
i don't wanna lose ya
see i picks my friends like i pick my fruit
usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast
some people need three dozen roses
at the table i sit, making it legit
back in the back
and i'm surrounded by
yeah, baby, give me one more night
it's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go
all we knew of home was just a sunset and some clowns, ah-aah
i wanna go home
'cause i'm on my way now
and those of us with ravaged faces
seems you cannot be replaced
that i forget about the pain
the birds in the morning don't sing anymore
but i always come back to myself
her mementos of affairs
don't say i didn't, say i didn't warn ya
rackin' my brain like crazy
tale as old as time
baby, here we go again
you're addicted to love
and everything you do
again then you can blame my stupid heart
i cried so much just like a child that's lost its home
the only card i need
saying it's gonna be alright
what the fuck did i do
i know when to pull you closer
oh, yeah, i spilled all my emotions tonight, i'm sorry
didn't think before deciding what to do
and big girls don't cry
the b-i-g d-a-double d-y k-a-n-e
everyone silent
you say you love me, i say you crazy
i was lost an' like in the wilderness
and baby i be movin' on
rest in peace, please light up a candle
but i broke my word
you can't awake me or even make me
if i have to beg and plead for your sympathy
he crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
i'll never let you go again, like i did
pushed as far as i can go
i stop and stand strong over mc's
you say you're sorry
i can see the pain
i think you know exactly what i mean
steal some
won't you please believe when i say
tonight, we smoked them out
grasping to control
another sunny place
i'm the same kid but i'm grown now
i'm just walking back to let you know back to let you know
one, don't pick up the phone
i just wanna make you mine
haven't i made it clear
blue are the people here
hopin' it would save me
don't care what you do you oh you
why do you say the things that you say?
to an island where we'll meet
to show me everything i could not see
you will see what you mean to me
i know just where to find the
cause you see people, people, people
hey, hey
now, i don't wanna fight this no
your eyes look like comin' home
speed jive, don't want to stay alive
i got the tongue that has outdone anyone.
till eve got him messin' with that old apple tree
that's what they don't see
and everything is blue for him
and in the master's chambers
i have a secret to tell
yeah, crazy cold way down there
then i know that you will plainly see
while i die
like those other sticky valentines,
you gave me freedom
but you brought me back to life
and all the things you do
it's me
honey you do me wrong but still i'm crazy about you
strolling in to take the ladies home
when you're wild when you're mad
but my body keeps on telling you, "yes"
best part
until you give up heaven so we could be together
and creative minds are lazy
me in your sweater
it's my world and i do what i like to
then out ice fishin', mmm,
always missing people that i shouldn't be missing
all your love, pretty baby, that i got in store for you
you only call me on the, you only call me on the
you're the only good i've ever done i've ever done
only a fool would say
now ain't that peculiar baby
well, i hope you come to see me in the movie
in the wedding cake?
i may be climbing on rainbows
i'm waking up in my dream
i hear the voice of rage and ruin
some blues are sad
that life's a bore
i get a little od
diamonds shinin’ drive in silence
someday, when you grow lonely
never gon' run away
the blood moon is on the rise is on the rise, na-na
and that's what they don't see
nobody wants to be alone
make a home down there as mine sure won't be
wait the worst is yet to come oh no
think of me in the
and this is not our fate
i'ma spend this check, everything on me, yeah
yeah, you may have all you want baby
dirty, dirty boy
but she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
and they tear apart me
but i wake up and everything's wrong
and a moo moo there.
'cause baby, you're a firework
but i've got a blank space baby
drag you down or drain you down
how can i love when i'm afraid to fall
i'll be there, whenever you want me
hey isn't this easy
if you need a lover
so you think you can love me and leave me to die
you a fuckin' fake
got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
chain you down or bring you down
this shit is not random nope
hmmmm-mmmnn-mmmnnn
and you went all in
since 1969"
reaching a fever pitch it's bringing me out the dark
your words cut deeper than a knife
i'm a flower in your hair
fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
and i guess i never told you
he went off to congress an' served a spell
find out what you want
ah, yeah, yeah, yeah
boy, when you touch me like that
but, shit, that wouldn't solve them
i'm the first to say that i'm not perfect
but i got somethin' you need, oh yeah
will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
and dimples who now lives in temple's
now we're under the covers
if i could break my dna to pieces
or inspect you or reject you
step in my lane
you know how to just make me want you, baby
you have many contacts among the lumberjacks
i don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
you never thought of anyone else
when you should be with me instead
on a summer evenin'
fucked around and got attached to you
woah!
for life is quite absurd
you watch me bleed until i can't breathe
or are we meant to be kind?
come into me
ain't no one going to turn me 'round
just get ready for work, work, work
we get set
you can take the darkness at the pit of the night
shit gets real good and bad
well, my friends, the time has come
i can't see clearly when you're gone
baby, you're all i need
with a blue little window
loves me better, than you
i will be brave
your vocab, i'll only ignore
like a tattoo, yeah
i am nothing like you, and no i'm not the type to
why does lovin' sometimes never stay long
people dancing all in the street
nothing you can see that isn't shown
it start beating again, if you were dead, i won't get hurt
god give us the reason
mm-mm, yeah, yeah, i'm all shook up
blue are the feelings
yeah, i know, i know
screaming, crying, perfect storms
with revenge and doubt
about you and me
and i was drenched to the bone
out here makin' these moves yeah
the city's cold and empty oh
this time i won't break your heart, your heart, no
but i see it on your face
i'm hittin so hard you could say it's a grand, slam, dunk, punks.
i can hear them echoing
that face of an angel
i really wanna stop
so don't stress don't stress, don't cry don't cry,
as they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
it's the chance i've gotta take
yeah we'll be counting stars
some folks think i'm hidin'
oh 'cause you know i'd walk a thousand miles
no matter what i do
and you know for you i'd bleed myself dry
light as a feather
my love is rotten to the core
you got the rest of the union to help you along
just to get it all out what's in my head
ah, yeah, yeah
but they'll never ever find that cure cure for love
you mistaken my love i brought for you for foundation
and i'm never gonna make it like you do
to say i'm in love with you
but you played it, you played it, you played it
it was long ago and far away
oh, the way he makes me feel
why does gladness become sadness
the day you kissed my lips
but they'll get theirs and we'll get ours if you can
yeah yeah
whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah
in the yellow haze of the sun
all you need is love everybody
take one look and die
still feel all alone
i shake it off, i shake it off
there's nothing surer
yes i'm saving all my love
whoa, sometimes i wonder
ooh, ooh
we're not the only ones doin' it like that, it like that
but it's the only thing that i know
sailed out of the gulf,
i know you're thinking i'm cold
she'd kick you out if she ever, ever knew
some dance to forget
nothing at all
well it's a doggone shame
'cause, darling, i'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
the beating of my heart is a drum and it's lost
doin' somethin' unholy woo
you sure have started somethin'
my love, he makes me feel like nobody else
repeat after me now r-o-m-a-n-c-e-e-e
taste that pink venom
i push it down, i push it down
yeah, ain't that just like a woman?
we stayed in separate rooms
and maybe we can play house for the weekend
and umm, let me boost ya with my raw rap.
so what you on, hobbs, dope or dog food?
i hear hurricanes a-blowin'
if you had a twin i would still choose you
and every step i take reminds me of just how we used to be
i say
everybody hurts sometimes
i draw the blinds
no one's around to judge me oh
don't want to,
way up and down the line
and i'm finding myself in the rain
leave america, two kids follow her
everybody sing, everybody dance
galileo, galileo
i swear to god, every day
when my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
her mind is tiffany-twisted
i really really really really really really like you
long as we got each other
always late, always late
now my hands are turnin' red
and maybe then we'd talk
you should have known better i was too young for you
i'll risk it all for you
cause the drinks bring back all the memories
they don't need to see me cry
i don't know how to act
move on
the attitude of doin' right
and i love you three thousand
i hope that you see this true
you reach in your pocket
i was thinkin' about what a friend had said
hey-ey-ey
we go higher and higher higher
because of you
do or die you and i get fly with rap expressions
talk to me, without you i can't breathe
oh, ain't she nice?
i feel your whisper across the sea
her silky hair was brown
she's never far away
just the way you are
and if you can't tell i'm a
you say you're fine i know you better than that
she got a lot of pretty pretty boys
those days are gone
blue canary in the outlet by the light switch and while you're at it
i said, ooh, i'm drowning in the night
we talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
i flow like a monthly you can't cramp my style.
something in my mindwanna talk bout it
fuck you and your mom and your sister and your job
when i stand here taking every breath, with you, ooh
i needed to lose you to love me, yeah
you took me from the shelter of my mother, i had never known
tripping over myself
you'll have to kick him out again
and, god, tell us the reason
and wendy's stealing clothes from marks and sparks
i ain't gonna cry, no
she's the only thing you've ever seen
to the bright side of the road to the bright sight of the road
you know i've loved you for these many years,
please bring me my wine
a one-track mind, you can't be saved
the song in my head, it was all that i had

hotcha
after midnight it's gonna be peaches and cream, hmm
someone like you
i may be crazy, don't mind me
that i'll only stay with you one more night
had never felt so low when i was vulnerable
you came out the blue on a rainy night, no lie
i know i never, never, never, never, never gonna leave you, babe
now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around
in this wrong situation
but i just got a feeling
is sleepin' with your ghost
like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
now i'm gonna reap what i sow
'cause she doesn't get your humor like i do
your heart beats in double time
but you can never leave"
with the dawn i still go on
ah! sweet mystery of life
heart beats fast

you got me jumping off the deep end
that's to have that girl that i love so fine
if i ain't got you you you
i knew you'd come back around

i found the one for me e yeah
i'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
in her dad's new car
is everything has changed
true love, true love
i can't help it, there's nothing i want more
so i daydream of what i could be
all the love i miss loving, all the kiss i miss kissing
and now the chapter is closed and done

this shit is not random
do you hear me, i'm talking to you
and baby i'll keep it
can you handle me the way i are
don't say that we must part,
and you love the game

love is torture makes me more sure
'cause i'd rather be home feeling blue
in our world to carry on, to carry on, yeah, yeah
i cut you off
oh, when skies are grey, when skies are blue
but always depressed, yeah
i'm feeling lonely lonely
of a cadillac

fight fire with fire
lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
inside the pocket of your
let me gonever never let you go
you're here with me
too afraid of a lot of changes

there ain't no cure
but some are glad,
and the acts of love in screams
i need you, i need you, i need you right now
they can really make you mad
if i took those
there's waylon and there's willie
cause the distant sky's always better than
and i've been there before
it's late in the evening
i got niggas tryna end me
and all that jazz
some would die and some would kill
some things in life are bad
when my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
windows down in alabama
and i used to say, "never say never..."
ain't that peculiar
play like roy rogers and slow down
get your motor runnin'
in the spring of forty-seven
it's getting late, dark outside
i guess that love
even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
just to not be yours
i've been so much in love with you baby til i don't want to see
everlastin' summer

we'll be making love the whole night through
i see the way you smile
blue his house
all i ask of living is to have no chains on me
i don't know if this makes sense, but you're my hallelujah
and the vision that was planted in my brain

i drew a line
and all the clubs you get in using my name
i, i drown in your memory
i can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for you
from where you are
if i get another chance to

straight out of a hollywood movie, baby

and i want you. do you want me do you want me too
and now that i'm without your kisses
it doesn't even matter how hard you try
stuck in a real bad dream
well, i heard your song, it makes me insecure
a blackened shroud, a hand-me-down gown
and i was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride
but alas, alack
like her artificial laughter
running out of time
driving slow on sunday morning, driving slow
who understands you?
never comin' down, uh
of everything we've been through
with illusions of someday

and i'll never let you fall
i'm gonna haunt you so, i'm gonna taunt you so

you spent some time away
a game which lif is pplayin'
lady of the house wonderin' where it's gonna stop
don't matter what time, what town, i can't get you gone
can i see you and shake your hand
had us walkin' in chains
when our pride was low
we kissed after taking vows
just own the night
the kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
baby baby
ain't it funny? rumors fly
a summer day that's fair
and you wanna know what i'm all about
thought i could be single forever 'til i met you
can't you see the glow on the window pane
filled with sadness, filled with gloom
was that good?
when we're holding each other
you shine just like the sun while the moon and the stars reflect your light
thought when i grew up i would be the same
please don't tell 'em how you found me
caution tape around my heart
to illustrate his last remark
but if i have to cry to keep you
needle and the thread, gotta get you outta my head
her lips are like a volcano that's hot
and the wonder of it all
don't wanna live
it's all a game to me
he would bet them every day
the only thing that's harder than sleepin' alone
i'm no schoolboy but i know what i like
if we were a couple years older
you don't even know how very special you are
you won't see how buried i am inside my grave
last thing i remember, i was
it's in my head, darling, i hope
i cross my heart and hope to die
we could've had it all
oblivion is all you crave
another time ah-ah, another day ah-ah
life it's for us to keep
only love, only love can hurt like this
baby don't you leave
all your loving, pretty baby, all your loving, pretty baby
show her where to park her girdle
i want more
all night long! all night, ooh, yeah all night
you know the door to my very soul
you're the best part, oh
girl you know that i come running when you call from a thousand miles
ah, get down on your knees, brown sugar
pull the sheets right off the corner
but it's time for me to go home
goodbye, everybody, i've got to go,
looking for someone who loves like me
a song comes on the radio
and i just hold my pillow tight
we took a boat to the land of dreams
and i've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime
and the perfect smile
and the cool, and the cool, cool night breeze
you had my heart inside you're gonna wish you
and a flower in your hair
come over and start up a conversation with just me
with their hand froze to the
i see this life like a swinging vine
you're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
and do anything to hear you say i'm yours
i'm just gonna shake
or shake me
on a yacht baby we would sail
quite as good as i should have
things that i don't get
and some were lost in the rocky mountains
only thing i need to know is if you wet enough
oh, i love you, ken
i'm better sleeping on my own
so many times before
i wish i knew yeah, i wish i knew you wanted me oh

i lied to you, i lied to you, i lied to you to you
for they came like herds of locusts
you can't get with the rage then tough tit-ty.
whoopee
ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
i'm the authentic poet to get lyrical
i can breathe without air
next to your heartbeat where i should be
when my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
divide
sometimes are just a one night stand
in the back seat of your rover
but i know that i'll make it out alive
couldn't keep his mouth closed in the house of chins
thinkin' all this devil shit
from the outside in
may be surrounded by
such a sweet, sweet guy was he!
and you ask me why i like to sing
from grassy plains to the mountain crest
but my words like silent raindrops fell
oh! honey baby, can't you see my tears?
i think somebody better put out the big light,
swing my heart across the line
don't know
still got sand in my sweaters
am i just paranoid?
if you'll be my honey
yeah we could stay alone, you and me, in this temptation
the wild dogs cry out in the night
keep it together,
there's no doubt, you're in deep
i sit alone, most every night
in darkness she is all i see you are all i see
make the stars look like they're not shinin'
everybody ain't got it, understand, son, yeah sorry
i can make all the stadiums rock
skidoo
he's just a poor boy from a poor family,
try to tell you, "no"
you answer all our questions further down this muddy road
when i hear the kick of a 808 bass, poom
but i'm breathing fine
i'm never gonna let you close to me
keep on falling for me, i love the way it feels
we'd always go into it blindly
you planning to get on one knee
i wish i knew wish i knew, i wish i knew you wanted me oh
just cast an eye
let's fuck in the back of the mall, lose control
and where will she go and what shall she do
who knows where the road will lead us
now, i don't wanna fight this
here i go!
if i'm not back again this time tomorrow,
all night long all night...
cause, boy, i don't give a fuck

sunburn freezer burn
and you say, "oh my god, am i here all alone?"
whenever i'm wrong, just tell me the song whenever i'm wrong i'll tell you

and then the day began
wrote it down and read it out

only my dying will tell

love can be right or wrong
tapes we push be straps with no safety catch
the never ending of a perfect day
oh, her mother's blood will curdle
and i know we're all blues
and i say that i'm through but this song's still for you
'cause i like, i like, i like
when we're out of touch
with little ms. sunshine, rihanna, where you at?

now that i've tried to
and wonder if you ever think of me
she's laughing up at us from hell!
this time, i'll never leave
i like smoke and lightnin'
i've got lots of love to give
there's nowhere unless you're there
the grass in the valley is starting to die
the color of colors
the scars of your love they leave me breathless
and i don't have to cover anything, i share it all
it's true
what are you hearing
and the crowds don't remember my name
the brothers with the positive reaction
that can light up this whole town
yeah, you, if it's not you it's not anyone
my heart's been on fire
oh shit, i'm the shit!
angel, angel baby you're my angel, baby
i know you since we were like ten
got a feeling that i'm going under
everybody hurts someday, ay ay
in a rainbow
i have died every day waiting for you
oh, did i say too much
days feel like a blur now
different girls on the floor, distracting my thoughts of you
sometimes, i don't know who i am
the big three killed my baby
you'll miss me, don't beg me, babe
i know the end is comin' soon
inside these
yes, i'm let loose
hmmm
i'm lightning on my feet
'cause i like you just the way you are
because i always speak with mentality
baby if you strip, you can get a tip
we worked in the sugar fields
i betcha lucky lindy never flew so high
uh huh, uh huh good girl gone bad
carry the news where are you?
oh, when i'm like this, you're the one i trust
you're my angel, angel baby
the smell of your skin lingers on me now
but you're still mine
here an oink.
two riders were approaching
you are the breathless hush of evening
here's to the ones that we got
listen to me huh
i need something "you proof," aw,
whose name i never could pronounce
so i better hold on
and i see forever in your eyes
i don't mind weepin' if it'll keep you by my side
yeah, ain't a picture with my hands, ohh!
got lost in your eyes
it'll leave you breathless mm oh
stop the clocks, it's amazing
every now and then i get inside my head
we're under pressure,
i came here to drop some money
life in plastic, it's fantastic
every breath, every hour has come to this
just remember that the last laugh is on you
turns out people lie
but i hate you i really hate you
and she'll never know your story like i do
cheers to the wish you were here but you're not
carcass rottin' in the bin
all things scabbed and ulcerous,
you were only waiting for this moment to be free
say it's not that hard
i know he's just not right for you
and i've been so caught up in my job
now troubles are many
drink my troubles away, one more glass of champagne
all my
ah ah ah ah
you know what i'm saying?
and she said
so good, see, baby
and says, "how does it feel to be such a freak?"
where i learned to swim
just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
that her man is darned unkind
up ahead in the distance
every time he wants to kiss me
oh yeah, you think you're really cookin' baby
long before daylight
at each other like we're going to war
no, i'm no one's wife
drinking fast and then we talk slow
lookin' at the world like, "where do we go, nigga?"
so i'm lettin' you fly
i'll beat you there
you're crazy girl, crazy girl, you should know it
i feel like i could die walking up to the room, oh yeah
i wish that i could know them one by one
it don't matter 'cause i'm the one that loves you best
i wish you wouldn't play with me
answers i won't get
that i'll only stay with you one more night yeah, yeah
all night and day
and every time you told me my opinion was wrong
all my exes live in texas
said, "this is the last one"
it's so wonderful and warm
come on and hear, come on and hear
and something is happening here but you don't know what it is
go on raise a glass and say, ay
i'm gonna rouge my knees and roll my stockings down
and any girl like you
for a pretty girl's glances
sang offkey in my chorus
oh and watched the ships,
now baby, maybe she's in need of a kiss
i will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
you can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
knows her mama done told her
incense was burnin' so i'm feelin' right, aight
so skeptical of love say what you say, but i want it more
how is it you never notice
there ain't nothing at all
you were always on my mind you were always on my mind
down
we can go anywhere you ever wanted
a just before you draw your terminal breath
ah ah ah
i'm in love with the shape of you
and open up the door for you
so save it, get gone, shut up
like it was easy
you're hollow, you follow
it never
they don't really know—
now you're all in the past
and you wanna see me do my thing
i wanna be your friend, go shoppin' in the benz
mama, oooh,
but, fuck, i'm still so empty
'cause gasoline's not measured in metric
give me love, give me fendi, my balenciaga daddy
and death's the final word
but every time you're there i'm begging you to stay
"this me, yeah baby, and the rest"
the lights are on, but you're not home
dream
and the cabbage wasn't hay!
whatever i said, whatever i did whenever i'm wrong, i'll tell you
i fear rivers over flowin'
i'm aching for you baby
i know just how to whisper
i'm not even half as pretty
baby and me were ripe for the pickin'
but more than friends
take off your party dress.
it all keeps adding up
yours yours until the rivers all run dry
scared the moment will pass
they come with prices and vices, i end up in crisis
in your hulk outerwear
you call me all friendly
so let's get drunk on our tears
i said "hey, a-what's going on?"
and an oink oink there.
it's like i just stepped outside
you're the only thing i see
hey
but that's just an old fantasy
i'm alright and you're a favorite
i love you so and that is why
ain't no half-steppin'
he turned to me as if to say, "hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"
think i want you
and we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears
cause you got thatthat, yeah
surrounded by couples all the time
falls perfectly without her tryin'
oh take that money watch it burn
come what may, every day
just the same
but now, i'm left here feeling stupid
j5's gonna rock a long long while
pa da da da da dam
your body next to me
i don't wanna see it end
yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone
in life we pay for change, let's make every second worth it
in g5's or better
me and my friends at the table doing shots
i'm surprised it got so
but you're the one who told me that you were in love
and himself and everybody around
you must always face the curtain with a bow
love you the way that i want love you the way that i want
go stupid, go crazy, babe
ain't it peculiar baby
though i've tried to resist being last on your list
but i'm not sure if i am laughing or crying
i've been waitin' for you
i have loved you for a thousand years
think you are a demon
we were as one, babe
i find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
you win some, lose some
so i
too big to hang out
with the sun beating down yes
i even heard the angels declare it from above
our love was in flower as summer grew on
rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling
and i, i'm getting too close again
there's no one quite like you you push all my buttons down
angel, you're my angel, baby
the next the next the next
over you
oh i'm in love falling like the stars
yeah, these are questions in my head
i'm feeling like this might be my time
and we found love right where we are
the sun will come out wait and see
i got in town a month ago, i seen a lotta girls since then
he's all that i'll ever need
here it's another saturday night and i ain't got nobody
i'm gonna tell you right away
a hand-me-down dress from who knows where
i know that i control my thoughts and i should stop reminiscing
because a vision softly creeping
i can hear that choo-choo whistle blow,
don't act like you don't know big narstie said
you think you broke my heart, oh, girl, for goodness' sake
my mild style reclines
fixin' up the governments an' laws as well
you must think that i'm new to this
sais tu, acadie j'ai le mal do pays
you're my, you're my, you're my air
and it's the only thing that i know, know
all the time all the way
how much more do i gotta drink for the pain
well, i'm back i'm back
so real, it feels like a dream
empty nights echo your name
that she calls friends
got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah
if pleadin' keeps you from, walkin' out that door
i need a hit, baby, give me it
in the muck with they butt up, what you wanna nut up.
a hopeless romantic all my life
i've been built up and trusted
next the formation of words that fit
isn't she pretty
you're the one that gives your all
get with the uh, toughest, toughest. rage!
as soon as i get you out my head
i can act like a star, i can beg on my knees
when they all should let us be
when skies are grey.
i wish you love
switch sides and i'm beside you
i have this thing where i get older, but just never wiser
my field in court, then again on second thought
'cause i'm plantin' seeds so i reap what i sow, ya know, ya know
where the word like wildfire spread
pat dawg, pat dawg, pat dawg, my dog, that's all
i need some shelter of my own protection, baby
through us he's given life to one
think it must be love i love you
all i knew
alabama, you got the weight on your shoulders
look what you made us do
got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
i bite my tongue, it's a bad habit
even though you mean the most to me
come on, barbie, let's go party ah ah ah yeah
and i'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
i hate that i want you
do you really love me, baby
has all been rehearsed
they've got to catch me if they want me to hang
i put you first and you adored it
in the end
made me think i deserved it
but kids don't know
and you tell me 'bout your dreams
come join the fun, it's a merry-go-round
boogaloo dudes and i want to relate to you!
each one a line or two
when you're movin' your body around and around
the path that i'm walking, i must go alone
you're the only love i've ever known
i know just how to fake it
make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared
and baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
i'll hit you when i land, can you fit me in your plans
hey, i've been thinkin' lately
in the sun
you can play
ah but it ain't doing jack
you should see the way the light dances off your head
back to abilene, my abilene
when she touched my hand, a-what a chill i got
and if you don't want to be down with me, you don't want to pick from my
gotta sit down and shut up, you did it to yourself
when i'm away i will remember how you
set fires to my forest
some people like to live
and make you realize, amanda
yeah, if you ever move on without me
banjos playing through the broken glass
just because i'm on my knees and swearing i would change
still we have fun
there's no love like your love
little things i should have said and done
and now my bedsheets smell like you
together we'll mend your heart
sorry if i'm way less friendly
what's going on in that beautiful mind?
do you love the rain does it make you dance
hey i'm talking to
that this has nothing to do with you
found a piece of shining gold.
well, you were a dancer and i was a rag
i'ma tip myself, i'ma spend it on myself
why do lovers walk away from themselves
but among the reeds and rushes
the ace of spades, uh
yeah, that's just like a woman, they'll do it every time
and you love startin' it, now i'm in a mood
yeah, i'm saving all my lovin'
way up and, way up and down the line
try to raise a family
oh, well, my hands are shaky, and my knees are weak
game plan solid, no cracks in it
his heart was a stone but then his hands
as long as you feel the same way
well, see her walking down that street
better than he can oh
her hair, her hair
take it slow but it's not typical
we attack like a bullet till your face relax
if you will agree
and i didn't wanna write a song
she's coming in, 12:30 flight
y me cansé de luchar y de guerrear en vano
and i take a deep breath and i get real high
anything, see my name is lucy, i'm your dog
'cause i know you wanna ask
try to tell you, "stop"
i don't know why
say, can i make you mine?
that's funny, i guess you've heard my songs
your heart's so big, but that ass is huge
all or nothing at all
so if you know like i know, instead of messing around
i look for his arrows every day
and the whole world whispering
when i did not know no pain
i am the toughest, toughest, toughest. rage!
but it all comes back to me in the end
big body girl that's kickin it, rippin it apart like jason.
we're gonna cause talk and suspicion
take a look into that mirror if you wonder why you lost me
what's that bill?
so i cross my heart and i hope to die yeah, yeah
nothing to declare,
ooh, you called me up again tonight
and there i stood and looked down
won't you
some day my happy arms will hold you,
i can make the runner stumble
i'm back in love sugar once again
no, i, i, i, i, i can't stop
back in black
and i've been trying to find a reason to get up
so make sure i have no clue
you
and i never like to admit that i was wrong
better than he can, oh
and i scream from the top of my lungs
life is good, wild and sweet
i see dead man grins
not anyone
another summer day
hope was a letter i never could send
boy, your silky ways are sweet
everybody's got a story
everything has changed
i'll be needing stitches
i been...
question who i am and what i could have done
mm-mm, yeah, yeah, yeah
so turn around walk away
all i know since yesterday
'cause you could scalp my cameo and i'll still have strength
and i guess you'll never know
left that stone in the river bed
i just wish i can be there with you
feeling used
how can you just walk away from me?
like a river, i flow
cupid's demanding back his arrow
but you were always on my mind
'cause you know i'd walk a thousand miles
when the store says, "sign for it"
keep flying and flying
or right after coffee
i came along
when you start every fight the blame is on you
after you've gone, after you've gone away
and time seems to go by so fast
without you, i can't sleep
and i cried at the curb
and nobody's coming to help
i'd rather be at home with ray
remembering all the times you fought with me
a mere musketeer that would dare to compare
reasons that i can't ignore, yeah
you want her, you need her
i just wanna live in this moment forever
but when i'm finished, i'm sure that you are soon to see
i need someone to share this heart with me
she's still a baby to me
we keep trying and trying
they never do
i bring the things to light, but you still can't see me.
out of nothing at all out of nothing at all
just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
and the wadin' rushing river we go steppin'
and turn into a
the crew with style that's on top of the pile
there was adam, happy as a man could be
you did some things that you regret, still ride for you
just by saying i love you
so complete in our love
davy, davy crockett, king of the wild frontier
oh that talk of opportunities tv
stupid boy making me so sad
when i listen to your music i just feel annoyed
alone and forsaken by fate and by man
'cause we're young and we're reckless
leave and get in a taxi then kiss in the backseat
you've got my head spinning, no kidding, i can't pin you down
a brown eyed girl in hand-me-downs
i've been done
we are more than lovers
one that i had never lived
but to wait for you, is all i can do and that's what i've got to face
we will never be uncovered again
baby, can't you see i'm calling?
want me to spell it out for you want me to spell it out for you
wishin' these memories would fade
in dull surprise when payment due
on me, than it did you
the western march had just begun
without you, don't wanna sleep fallin' in
is in the bank in the middle of beverly hills
work, work, work
to all the sleeping giants who must wake
all i want is a good guy
no kiddin', no ceiling, that's limitless
ah, come down, down, down, down, down, down, down
i try to make you stay, but your
i've never been so wide awake
oh-i-oh-i-oh-i-oh-i
ain't that perfection?
i see you standing there
masked up and i’m still in celine
i can make the final block
i will never, no never neglect you
i can't believe i'm the one
carry the news now you, all his friends!
all your love, pretty baby,
go go go
no, i can't sleep until i feel your touch
all i'll have to do is act naturally
a lament that's made
to all the lonely sailors who have trouble beeing seen
but when i try to remember
everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
been counting the days since november
oh, i used to say
that's okay baby only
and each day it grows more and more
and if life belongs only to the strong, alfie
clarity, peace, serenity
they'll do it every time, sure will
'cause i'm back
you are my sunshine
i had so many dreams
seek it out and
is this the real life?
painkillers only put me in the twilight
that's kept me hanging about
you were a phonograph, i was a kid
i swear to god, when i come home
he would spend it on the ponies
he would spend it on the girls
enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow
some day i hope to make him mine, all mine
and when it's time, you'll know
and anytime you want it to stop
come on baby
baby, i have no story to be told
you gave her your sweater
your daddy lives by himself
love, love, love
can't you see that i'm the one
a peculiar-arity
i said hey
and now i'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you ah
sometimes i wonder how we ever came to be
to analyze my dreams
i, i don't wanna let this go
how they dance in the courtyard
gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now
don't need you here anymore
we got some straightenin' out to do
baby, baby i can hear the wind whipping past my face
and i can't keep this smile off my face
if it's love, there ain't no in between
i don't need your love, so you can try all you want
holding on
love is all you need oh yeah
and all that jazz and all that jazz
and now we're flyin' through the stars
her love like the leaves now have withered and gone
turn my sorrow into treasured gold whoa
if i ain't got you baby
cool wind in my hair
let me go will not let you go
i didn't mean it
you're the tylenol i take when my head hurts
baby but the only thing faded is me
i can make the bad guys good for a weekend
waaaah!
will you tell the
at the body shop
i should have known, i should have known
fill you up, then run it back again run it back again
we could've had it all tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
here he come
oh, yeah
so dust off your highest hopes
there's no love, like your love
i ain't lookin' to block you up
bless you all and keep you with the strength to understand
i just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
and watch this hurtin' feeling disappear
i'm better than that, i'm better than that
that it's just not enough
don't really know you
something in me says "whatever"
i know there's something much more
from nights we don't remember
it's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
you're the one that i love
hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
you're my, you're my, you're my air you're my air, oh
aching, begging you to come help
reaching out for someone i can't see
born on a mountain top in tennessee
and i don't care if i never land
oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
ooh come on baby
cause if you like the way you look that much
beats fast
come on, baby, it's you
why do people fall in love
you know i'll always be your slave
i walked into this empty church i had no place else to go
the biggest fool that's ever hit the big time
in the middle of the woods
ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
all day and all of the night
take the world in a love embrace
and i don't really care
and the cool, and the cool, and the cool, and the night
or select you or dissect you
actin' like they wanna know me
nobody else
buried
hey have you ever tried
i can't help feeling rolling in the deep
oh, now
i know i made you fall
but i'm the kane, so yo, you know the outcome
but now there's nobody by my side
you only call me on the weekend
california out to georgia, florida then up to illinois
hard times like, yah!
how hard it is
they're as deep as a well
all i ask of the living is to have no chains on me
way up, way up, way up and down the line
your smell sexy, it lingers on me
we can work without the perks just you and me
out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all
where you go i'll follow
