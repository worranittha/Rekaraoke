i want it all give it all i want it all
matter of fact, it need interest
it escapes from my hands into moonlight
i'm already hurt

first one up was a preachers son
bwemba nkwagala kati i won't let you go
i said, "don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"

boy i'm pleading, eh
cooking up a dream, turning diamonds into snow
here's to the future for the dreams of youth
cried on his shoulder 'cause life is hard
saw you downtown singing the blues
now you're just another one of my problems
he said show me what you got girl
and she's got the barley fever
life imitates art
how can i show you? show me the way
all the streetlights
mimicking me is a fucking bore
skate and smoke and ride
i'm going to mars with my girl don't call your exes
leads to a center in my head
we could flip the coin, i'll be your slave ooh, ooh, ooh
i show him how that neck work
did i say that out loud?
call me aphrodite
let it grow
if i just believe it, there's nothing to it hey
move your mouth up to my lips
because my instagram's weak as fuck
baby, if you care, then don't you dare say
i'ma fuck him 'til he sing
then, maybe in the next lifetime we could make up
you go your way
we make the rules
to play someone's game, or live my own life
but now i know the meaning of true love
do you ever feel like going back to the start?
so many things i would say to you
i see me running through that open door
watch you politic with people less fortunate, like my self
but you already know that, you already know
now that's all done
oh, and you know i would if i could
take you home, i, i'll give you a blanket
but i'm not gonna do what i hear me say, oh

it's her body or nobody, i refuse to compromise
when he's bad he's bad
light me up like the 4th of july
key lime and perfume and festivals
give me a mausoleum in rhode island with dad, grandma, grandpa and dave
to forget the things they fear
how do you like me now?
send me away with the words of a love song
you won't know, you gonna lose on a good bitch
you is a off-brand-ass nigga, everybody know it, your homies know it, everybody fuckin' know

skippidy doo da thank you lord for makin' him for me
dance me all around the moon
this dick ain't free, i mean, baby
you're so fun
lord, make me a rainbow, i'll shine down on my mother
but, sometimes, it's just not your time
doing your hair in the mirror with your makeup
why'd you have to end the show
turn me up a lil bit
or whatever you want to do
whistle at me as my hips go sway
it's so hard sometimes with a star
i met you on the boulevard, wind through my hair, you blew my mind
i know he's in over his head
i'm not about to walk away
the guy i ever thought i would meet, so
you had one last pint before the cops broke in
screwed up, scared, doing anything that i needed
and sing it for my babies on the tour life
'cause i know i'm better off alone better off alone
why'd you move that bojangle clock
i have made the big decision
if don't really care, see
caroline
what are we livin' for? tell me, tell me
milkshake bring the boys to the yard
we're sinkin' into the sand
on the radio, dancin' in the night
in my linen and curls
look, the new me is really still the real me
and the sweat is getting steamy
and this kind of love's forever
that he caught on rhode island beaches
baby, it's already too late
away from the big city
'cause sometimes even a real brother gots ta say that's right girl
i love our playing house, love our dressin'-up nights
i see nothing greek in it
get into your truck
i'm trying not to let the crowd next to me
ever thought that they could do that for me
and to pay for bills i'd figure the job out
people do you hear me, just gimme the sign
believe me, honey, i've tried
doomed from the start
your spirit can sit and watch tv by my side
walk that ass, you're the only one i love
i believe i can fly i can fly
throw down your umbilical noose so i can climb right back
i got a whip plus room in the front seat
maybe i spend more time in hollywood than i should
it's killing me slowly
in the national park sky, it's a shame and i'm crying right now
i really don't care anymore
we thank you so much
big girl in the red dress
i guess i might as well dive in
i'm the one you want for conversation, sation, sation
of all of the evils of this town
see you laced at the toe
nothing's off limits
at the rate i was going, i'd be lucky to die
and the monkey's getting grinner
i been spending my time going off
so i don't have to say
the last stand
if he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
oh, you got me sounding good too, ay will will
i don't wanna go just yet
guns in the summertime, chic-a-cherry cola lime
aaron ended up dead and not me
never one without the other we made a pact
oh hi, lookin' kinda shy
if you can find the time
dark blue
i like me some women, not a bunch of sausages
i'll fix your lunch, and you'll fix mine!
need you, baby, more, more, more, more
come on down to florida, i got somethin' for ya
the battles that you've won
porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
and pretending that nothing means anything
be us against the world
i don’t know what it is that
shawty say the nigga that she with can't hit
what can i do? what can i say?
you got a face like the madonna
eighty proof all up in my bloodstream
i buy you champagne but you love some henny
pension, more pension, you're pinchin', my consensus
know you get sick of the games 'cause i do too
yayo, yayo, yayo
come on, come on and shut the door, girl
it's no wonder every man in town
if you lie down right next to me
manyi okwagala
i want it all
and i like it when it’s me at night
from the top of the hundredth floor
laughin' really hard and it makes me wanna cry
i thought you were the one from the jump that confirmed it
but it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
adventure seeker on an empty street
i i, i've never, ever been this far away from home
just do what you do best with me
don't you know the times i've tried?
i don't wanna do this anymore
i wanna get off, but i keep riding the ride
you could put it on a swing
but then you try to touch them touch, touch
i'll do it on my own
never do belong to anyone i find
we won't survive
tied him down to my queen bed
if this is all that's real
turn it up hot, loving you is free
he loves the heart shape my ass is
all i wanted to do was kiss aaron greene and sit by the lake
i could fuck him in the range
put her on a chain
no more photographs
flowers in my hair, roses on the vine
every day is a lullaby
but even if the whole world falls over
i really do it's killing me slowly
if i can see it, then i can do it
drop it like it's hot girl
and if i do, will you be there with me, father, sister, brother?
i'm gonna try to nullify my life
but i'm gonna try for the kingdom, if i can
'cause i'm living ten lives, i go crazy about mines ayy
i used to shoot up my veins in neon
now that i know the way it ends
this is my life, you by my side
i wouldn't be aware of a glacier
when i put a spike into my vein
and the buyers can be found
will i have one of mine?
going insane, feel you picking up and moving things inside my brain
baby you wanted me sadder
but lately, i can't see
i can now retire from politics after having had the birthday sang to me
you spend it like you earned it
kb, do you love me? are you riding?
i sing it into my music, i'm crazy
the words we chose, irrelevant
talk to me with that whiskey breath
once, twice, three times
oh baby
and i guess i just don't know
like six times 'til i'm sick and i cry
a-a-a-a-andre ndre on the beat
running wild
i mean it started as a conversation
like i never made end's meet, eatin' your leftovers and raw meat
from the block, like you jenny
has come here show
have my one true love tonight
would start out with a little private party
i drove into the flames
i'm so crazy about mine wheezy outta here
down the court road early
sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat
okay, tell me what the deal is, you know i'm the illest
i'm going to pluto with my girl oh, shorty
you need a freak like me
used to be the one that i idolized
hey, 'cause i believe in you
a baby sittin' right by my side
it's not looking good now
tell me that you love me, baby, say it again
the bar was hot, it's 2 am, it feels like summer
cause we burnt out, that's what you do
guess i got what i deserved
kinda modest that's just me
then thank your god that i'm not aware
with you dance
its time to face the music
baby, don't you dare say that you'll braid my hair, babe
used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof

and i'll go my way
and god knows i tried

we should catch it while dancing
don't you see it?
i see in technicolor
to carry a child
when you get home tonight
'cause i wanna go to space
i think about it every night and day
were not in your right mind
what the fuck's wrong in your head to send me away never to come back
twisting lime into the drinks that they made
w-w-walk that ass, you're the only one i love
baby wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
swingin' in a nightgown underneath the old oak tree
gravity won't hold me down
pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
high, there's a reason for my high
i want you
you want a good girl that does bad things to you you want a good girl
i done fell in love twice but i gotta be lying
and she said i better get walking
when they all know that you ain't
ran my fingers threw his hair
i said "he loves my heart shaped sunglasses
a young fighter screaming, with no time for doubt
but by friday i'm revived
lay me down on a bed of roses
you and i 'til the day we die
god's dead, i said, "baby, that's alright with me"
my, my, lookin' really fly
fast on cherry wine
my local rock star, the really big crew
wearing nothin' but the summer bruises on my knees
i caught you boy, i caught you boy
shining like a fiery beacon
finally, i'm crossing the threshold
almost victorian with you, you can talk to me
take that shirt off, baby, put it on me
been feeling like i'm running out of space
baby, giddy up
and it's nothin' to stop me girl
you me number one thing i sing about

i'm cool and i'm calm
when you would pay tribute to me
he found me waitressing at ruby tuesday's
ever since i found my fame
i believe i can fly
your advice
get drunk
it is my pride and i really know i shouldn't stay but i don't wanna go

brooklyn move my soul like this
i'm always going to be right here
who would have thought forever could be severed by
sink me in the river at dawn
and all my girlfriends
when we both know that you ain't
sunbather, moon chaser, queen of empathy
happiness is a butterfly
i believe i can touch the sky
but their eyes are on the ground
i was working down in the corner cafe
i'm likin' your game
rock and roll sent us insane
what the fuck is really going on?
i could fuck him in the rain
i'ma get my uncle sam to fuck you up
hm-mm... fly, fly, fly
i really do chances in my veins, running out of time
but one day i woke up like
drink lime green, stay up 'til dawn
i know what you're thinking of
play it my way
looking into his eyes, i think he's already hurt
just one thing before i go
fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
it's not looking good now, oh
for the things that they hold dear
just five more minutes and i'm gone
simanyi kwebuzabuza
we met with a goodbye kiss
love girls, you and i, so who do we trust?
i know we'll probably lose, only got tonight
gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
and we could cruise to the news
light up my life
now we're separated by oceans, vast
drama got a bentley, let me drive it
it all kicked off i had no choice
and of himself, and those around
i wish i could eat your cancer when you turn black
uh
pulling on my dress, holdin' me too tight
lets play it my way lets play
so tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from falling apart
that comes from energies combined
hear the cry of youth hear the cry of youth hear the cry of youth
their arches are illusions, solid at first glance
going from this land here to that
yeah
know you get, know you get, know you get
did you really think i'd do you wrong?
fuckin' need you, baby, more, more, more, more
oh oh oh oh oh

shorty like a
but first i know it starts inside of me
you'll braid my hair, babe
you want my
but she doesn't make a sound
christ he told her not to bother
i'm thinking, isn't it a miracle that life comes from inside?
i wish i'd have stayed
he was a proper englishman
she's just trying to impress us
and i'm down for you always
bullshit, matador, matador
the world on drugs
there are guns that blaze around you
the o-o-o-o-o-one
you remind my heart
baby, you'll never grow old in my eyes
someone said you had your tattoo removed
save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em, oh

i am lyin', usin' again come on
i'm feeling you boy, you're liking me too
get high by the beach, get high
i can fly i can fly
you know what i want to do
i used to think that i could not go on
this is my commitment, my modern manifesto
i saw it last night
had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
maybe the days we had are gone
don't even know what you're good for
all of the guys tell me lies, but you don't
wonderin' what it would sound like coming from a girl or a boy
ah, when the heroin is in my blood
wilshire boulevard if we choose
where a man cannot be free
yadde wayita mu bingi nolwala omutima
couldn't make this last
for all the things you've done
or maybe get your attention for a minute or two"

the special love you have for me
you'll braid my hair, see
put your red boots on
there’s a place on valentine
you got me and bad way girl got me in a bad way girl
happy birthday to you
didn't take a second to notice
and her last man was a pussy, had a vagina
it wasn't my idea the cocktail of things that twist neurons inside
yeah, they're saying i'm insane
'cause it makes me feel like i'm a man
leaving everything i ever knew behind
she's just hanging around
she ain't got no time for no groupie love hmm
like the way the bling on your pinkie ring shine
now let me see you
i can't even go for a ride
it's innocence lost
when i look back
palm trees in black and white
i want it all, i want it all, i want it all and i want it now
i would make you stay
run along like i'm supposed to
when i hit the club, i walk in with a small village, and
cigarettes, robitussin
there's nothing to hold on to hold, hold
i’m just gonna walk, i’m gonna walk away
she'll know i'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
i'll do what you want to do
and now i do
as much as i love wakin' up next to you?
i can't wait no more, no
sat in the shower
get drunk, get drunk get drunk, get drunk
i just wanna see you wake up

wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
he's already hurt
blaqnmild, you a genius, you diggin' me?
in my diamonds and pearls
thank you!
i want it all and i want it now
not that smart but i've got things to say
lately i've been sunning in the l.a. river bed
maybe the way that i'm living is killing me
lana del rey, how you get that way?
i know your lips say
i got a new boy, and that nigga trade!
i'm so high
his god protects him but
i need that black card and the code to the safe
and shit's even brighter, you're gone
yea, yea, yea, guess who's back
"fuck yeah, give it to me"
you were just a little stowaway
no, not this time
having my baby there next to me
while you're t-t-t-t-touching me
i want you, i want you
that's how we do it, like
i like to watch them say
just five more minutes and i'll go
i'm just gonna walk, i'm gonna walk away
i wish that i was born a thousand years ago
keep him waiting 'til he try
i wanna move
and we're doing just fine
but now i know
do shit to keep me turned on
do too, uh
no one's gonna take my soul away
i got a new complaint
if i just believe it, there's nothing to it
taking our dreams, turning them to things
if you don't really care
i guess i need me a ride or die
that i always thought it could be
in the land of gods and monsters
fuck it, i love you i moved to california, but it's just a state of mind
the colors used to lure you in shut up, shut up
nja kubaawo every time
we could cruise to the blues
all dressed up for a hit and run
so i moved to california but it's just a state of mind
you know i can find some time just to get
where i come from
with the leather all around me
you moved to california, but it's just a state of mind
twirl me twice
when i'm closing in on death
here's to the future
i don't know just where i'm going
open you're eyes and what do you see
and all the dead bodies piled up in mounds
my babe, made me sing to a fire escape
let's make love, let's make love
there's a whole world outside
the universe inside
nkusaba love yo
you ain't even buy me no outfit for the fourth
think about those years
i broke my wrist
open your eyes and what do you see
na na na na na na na
and you can't help me, not you guys
and pretend that you're still here
if i just spread my wings i can fly
without a mercedes benz and twenty-four inch rims
boy, look at you looking at me
and if anybody in the whole wide world
out outta here alive
when i was fifteen, naked, next-door neighbors did a drive-by
'cause i know that
now she actin' freaky, she was coming off timid at first
something to get the thought of you and i off my mind
'cause when the blood begins to flow
fishtail what's the matter, like that
you give me butterflies
and i want it now
i like how you talk, how you speak, how you look at me
where is mine?
been pumping gas
don't you dare say
dancing there in the hot, hot sun
'cause i came out here to see
i'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
feelin' hella rare
and when you get to topping
when we both know that you lie
i don't know why you tryna go big, nigga you ain't shit
another word
you could be a bad motherfucker
find your astral body, put it into my eyes
do too, do too
tracing fingertips over plastic bags
let's, let's make love
i'll treat you like a holiday
looking really hot while i make ya cherry pie
sijja zanya drama
freak like me tryna freak you down
so let there be light
now i moved on and you switched phones
he's just hanging around hanging around
what kind of mother was she to say i'd end up in institutions?
i'm yours and i'm free and i'm fun
when you got the sauce, you know they running off with it
crack house on the corner
ahh, ahh
there's no more chasing rainbows and hoping for an end to them
get high baby, baby, bye bye
finally
you're my woman and i'm your man
you said that you didn't mind
and i'll be wearing white when i come into your kingdom
i'm doing it for all of us who never got the chance
baby wants a dance
sometimes it feels like i've got a war in my mind
cuts on his face 'cause he fought too hard
wear my blinders in the rain
i'm the happiest girl in the whole u.s.a.
make your heart run steady
charlie, stop smoking
they never saw us coming
five more minutes and i'll go
oh oh, oh oh oh, oh
sometimes when i miss you
and go back to being a serene queen
ooh
its how you play the game and ima play it like man
i keep on walking in the daytime
but i love that man like nobody can
give you two seconds to cry
buy a cup of coffee
cristal, crystal champagne glasses"
this pussy off the chain
but we don't have the same soul
you got that medicine i need
beat on it, beat, beat on it, mercy like a black belt give
this can go one of two ways
i can't wait no more
i can't even front girl
and everybody puttin' everybody else down
i'm so crazy about mine
what i never did is done
if you can hear me, does it really have to end?
she make me look like 2010 kris humphries
you remind my heart you remind my heart
but they'll never forget our names
'cause love's hard to find
who never got to fly at night shut up, shut up
if i can see it, then i can be it
you mi number one thing i think of
fuck it, i love you wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
and you're making me crazy
with you
spice up your life, come get a freak do, do-do, do-do, do-do
'cause love can find a way to make your feet run heavy
except i want you by my side
all the colombians like

just one more minute that's why we moved it
d-down for you al-
that you wanna but your heart's a no
i know you don't understand
hey, i could take a big bat
okyusa my programme

thinking, "i wish i could extrapolate some small intention
our honeymoon
well i, i can barely breathe
we both know the history of violence that surrounds you
i don't know what it is that
god knows i lied
i need forty acres and a mule
and don't say you're over me
never planned that one day, i'd be losing you
and regret
lately i've been thinkin' about how things used to be
you are my babe
thirty blocks to fordham road

the sharp knife of a short life
but i've got things to say
i watch the skies getting light as i write, as i
heart skipping one two
baby, if you care
come on get drunk, get drunk
turning slowly
what are we livin' for? tell me
choice is devastated, decapitated the horseman
kept me up watchin' pornos in poverty
in different worlds
it gets dark so i can see the stars
i'm leaving
wonderin' what they'd look like on a newborn child
same old song like an echo, ooh
and i'll tell ya, things aren't quite the same
them bitches you fucking with, i know they gon' need some practice
dropped a pin to my parking spot
went and sold drugs 'til we got a bigger bankroll

i catch a dollar in the wind and i
don't need your money, money
then thank god that i'm good as dead
thought you'd realize i would know
caroline, will you be with me?

open up the red curtains
one of 'em comes over
innocence lost
hollywood and vine, black rabbit in the alley
you snort it like a champ, like the winter we're not in
they gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
every man deserves to see the sunrise
to red, blue and yellow lights
i like to light up the stage with a song
makes me feel this way
so i stop painting red flags green
'cause baby, you got me, you got me open, yes you do
just an alley creeper, light on his feet
i want it all yeah yeah yeah
pleading for your love every day
one more hug or two
christ he told his mother
your mouth up to my lips
will you be mine?
i'm leaving them behind
about all the jim-jim's in this town
not a man for compromise and where's and why's and living lies
if you lay down right next to me
it's so surreal, i can't survive
you can't feel it and you're tired
history will hate us
i want you boy, i want you boy
i cannot lie when my hand is on your thighs
just in case you're wondering, never just one dream
all the floridians like
nkusuubiza sijja kulwaza
you don't know that? i don't even care
no need to say
i'm leaning on the everlasting arms
and that blood is in my head
lights, camera, acción
and then i'm better off than dead
no, i ain't 'fraid of a little pain
fuck it, i love you
you're in the club, living it up
heroin, be the death of me
spin me like ballerina super high
i'm your favorite girl
kinda like see-saw, up and down on the d
i want it all, i want it all and i want it now
you sneak me in your mom's house
so bring 'em along wit' ya, i'll teach 'em how to smash ya
but you don't go 'cause truly there's nobody for you but me

there are roses in between my thighs
can't you see it?
baby just forget 'em
last one down was an englishman
the stone mary in the garden
i don't really wanna know what's good for me
with the pain and anger can't see a way out
motel sprees, sprees and i'm singing
if they're gonna talk let 'em
it's so good to have someone to be so bad with
i just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
to red, blue, and yellow skies
living in silence for too long
then i really don't care anymore
let there be light
let's make love
but i’m not gonna do what i hear me say
cos we're a match made in heaven
trapmoneybenny
no words can save us
but shawty, i'ma hit it, hit it like i can't miss
he was sneaking a cigarette
god know i lied
had the whole thing mapped out
oh baby yeah you're on the run
been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
if you no go hit and run
a classic white milkshake
me and god, we don't get along
see 'cause i may be young but i know
yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
"i love you, have a beautiful day!"
so i'm living it all, yes i'm living it all
cigarettes, and robitussin
i want it all, i want it all, i want it all, and i want it now
they just kept beggin for
thunder in the air, trouble on my mind
hold me
i plan to address them another day
so here we are
this kitty insane
maybe i'll take my glasses off
i'm not that smart
i've got nothing much to live for
my other nigga is on, you off
he wanted them three rounds, dc had to come help him
you ain't no king
i am sleepin' with your best friend
spin me like a ballerina, super high
they are one mistaken girl
when you talk, it's like a movie
there's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
like my part was i
oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
people never die in miami, ooh-ooh
every dog has it's day, now doggy style shall help
'resha, do you love me? are you riding?
baby don't be scared, come on honey, smile
you're on the run
bring that ass back
was not discerning
in another life
this shit got me in my feelings
i know we'll get him yet
as they bow down to me
you make the coffee, i'll make the bed
you lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
i'm not who i used to be
gave myself two seconds to cry
baby you are so much fun
to get me what i want
had neither fought nor found you
ye nsonga lwaki i'm pleading
kiki, do you love me? are you riding?
it gets dark, yeah, it gets dark
dance around like i'm insane
you always liked the taste of blood
without trial like a stowaway
how just the thought of such things can bring you so much joy?
you tell me, "life isn't that hard"
'cause when the smack begins to flow
you don't love me, you just networkin'
and thank god that i just don't care
you're in the bar, playing guitar
you never been with no one as nasty as me
and thank you for letting life turn out the way
you wanna watch me while i watch tv
there's a million of 'em selling
caught you boy, i caught you boy
make me into something sweet
and i feel just like jesus' son
you need to send your location, i can't think
and i get off when i point the gun
'cause i've been going off and they don't know when it's stopping
funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'
fuck it, i love you it turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie
i just needed two seconds to be me
i believe i can fly woo
i hum it on the phone like every night
and on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos
john met me down on the boulevard
woo i can fly
without thinking about a little baby
she let me know she watching
then it breaks
i'm clocking chicks left and right
and you knew i had to say it, but them day's gone
and life was nothing but an awful song
if we can pick it up, then just tell me where and when
evidently all i seen was spam and raw sardines
we make out in your mustang to radiohead
white lines, pretty baby
'cause life imitates art
i've never known the lovin' of a man
if i get a little prettier, can i be your baby?
every man gets his wish promised me this
every man gets his wish
it can't be true
code to the safe, code-code to the safe-safe
this is my show
i want it all yeah
blame it on the crushed dreams that we used to all have
and kiss the happiest girl in the whole u.s.a.
burnt by fire
i ain't afraid of a little pain
it's so sweet, pouring you a drink
you were stuck in the hotel bar
it's the greatest, it's the greatest day
but just give me, huh, what i know is mine
you can whistle for it
d-d-down for you always
oh girl, come and shut the door, go on, shut it
out of the black out of the black
and all my birds of paradise shut up, shut up
give it to him
you had me on the worse
bet that he thinking this a game
i don't know why it is that i wanna stay
just wait until you get a taste
see i was on the verge of breaking down
you see it you that's gon' be winnin'
then i jump in the pussy like a lake, i'm a diver
let go of my hand
you can all go take a walk
put your hands on my waist, do it softly
if we can pick it up, just tell me where and when
i'm leaving it up to you
don't just say it
it turns out california's more than just a state of mind
that could happen to a girl who's already hurt?
but it's killing me slowly
i would be your girl
for me, you are the one
we keep all our promises
and in my eyes, it’s always nighttime
because when the smack begins to flow
and if i wasn't so fucked up, i think i'd fuck you all the time
but i'm gonna play your game like it hey yeah
and i guess that i just don't know
this game is just 'bout fantasy tonight
will i die? or will i get to that ten-year mark?
oh
on a great big clipper ship
i learned how to make love from the movies
in a bad bad way that's right girl
so now i sing
i know you know how i feel
i was an angel living in the garden of evil
and all the dope fiends
all i wanna do is get high by the beach
that stabbed her way to save herself
did i say that out loud? i'm so crazy about mine
white lines, baking powder on the stove
kept you waiting there too long, my love
skipping rope in the bayou, bayou
used to talk shit, now i wonder what they must think

but boy your hips say that your gonna when you hold me
fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly

from this me and you moment don't you understand
'cause i want you, and i need ya
but i'm not scared, there's nothing to lose now that i've found you
little bullet car if we choose
if they don't think we're good together
i used to kick it with the kids that rocked that osiris
everything is fine now, everything is fine
the brightest star on hollywood and vine
now look, i'm not insinuating that
god knows i died
thousand dollar plates, fine china
five percent tint, and air conditioning vents
tell her that she beautiful every day, i remind her
this lifestyle made us
i need a photo with drake
she eyes me like a pisces when i am weak
babe, you never been with no one nastier than me
just 'cause i'm young doesn't mean i don't know how to play besides girl
how you get that way?
hopefully reincarnation will bring us back to the place we belong
i hope someday that we will meet again
out of focus
but it's all i've got all i've got
but then we make moves and we make plans
the long haul freight train
we're gonna party like we're
god knows i lost
and i, i'm moving at the speed of light, i had to go
to me, but babe
you said that i might
shorty like a thousand dollar plate, fine china
for, and for shut up, shut up
everything you do is elusive
might be a reason
on a sailor's suit and cap
so if she leaves, i'ma kill her, oh, she'll die
i put those records on
fuck you nigga, don't call me no more
i'ma need the whipped cream
i feel free when i see no one
i'm running temperatures
tell me now if you're trying to ride with me
i was waiting in the getaway car
'cause i want ya, and i need ya
and maybe then you'll hear the words i've been singin'
i believe i can soar
when you have everything
i'm falling for you like dominoes
life is awesome, i confess
if i die young, bury me in satin
will the baby be alright?
i said i'll serve you up
be the man i ought to
i hope someday that we could meet again
'cause i know i'm better off alone
need you, baby, like i breathe you, baby, ah, ah
we're getting drunk and driving
all that time, without a word
it's the greatest, it's the greatest day, oh
side stage, fans screamin' causin' migraines
what you been up to, my baby?
in my linen and pearls
let's have a baby
good morning, mornin', hello sunshine
all those days became so long
every man gets his wish you told me this
baby boy you make me sigh-igh-igh-igh
meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
kissing my stilettos
i want it all yes i want it all
that you'll braid my hair
i'm still trying to be the best version of me
yamborghini-high, but she ain't on my grade hmm, hmm
it turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie
i'm moving to a coleheme
gonna see it all before he says goodbye
to even your honey dew
there was still more story to go
and all the politicians makin' crazy sounds
the california sun and the movie stars
late nights, head hurtin'
there once was a time, that i could not imagine
i know you get, sicker, games, too
how it would feel to say
now she got me, ooh, doin' somersaults in it
what are y'all talking about?
