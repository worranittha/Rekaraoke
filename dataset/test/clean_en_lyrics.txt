shes wondering what clothes to wear
im the first to say that im not perfect
like the heart in a trash where you should
feel my hearts intention
all i wanna be yeah all i ever wanna be yeah yeah yeah yeah
like a criminal undercover
smooth like butter cool shade stunner
who wants my money ill tell you: who i dont fuck with
but i know what they want from me
all i wanna be yeah all i ever wanna be yeah yeah
its late in the evening
an empty shell
just like nicotine heroin morphine
yeah i owe it all to my mother
never really gave enough
for you for you for you
girl youre so perfect i think that its working
we both know its a cruel world
ill be your platinum ill be your silver ill be your gold
we go to a party
dont forsake this life of yours
now were having dinner
we got that love so big
all by my side

said you could keep them
all of them times that you talked but you lied
some just rather say goodbye bye
i can size you up
through my fingers are so numb well take it slow
when she looking so sweet
i know youre always on the night shift
likes to drink and smoke some doja
then she came through and topped me off
i used to wanna be
girl my mood changed when you walked through the door
we dont need no wings to fly
come correct when you approach me
i answer too fast

i just wanna show you how deep my love is
because i see the love light in your eyes
yeah any time i feed you get me no

i cant pretend i cant ignore youre right for me
ill beat you there
keep rockin dawns
feeling all the highs feeling all the pain
i need to tell you something
she puts on her make up
thinking bout a way to get you off my mind
and everyone turns to see
get it let it roll
you you the one that i argue with i feel like i need a new girl to be bothered with
you know that i want to be with you all the time
but you wont see me break call you up in three days
looking for their barbie
but every time i look at you i just dont care
she gotcha boy doing crazy things that i never thought id ever do no
boys are always playing dolls
but now i wake each day
nothing ever mattered to me more than this
off of one touch i could overdose
it doesnt mean a thing
and then she asks me do i look alright
so if you need perfect im not built for you yeah
keep walking forward
used to tell me skys the limit now the skys our point of view view
im so in my head
i feel like i could die walking up to the room oh yeah
her friends wish they knew me
cause i know that i am yours and you are mine
with you oh wow oh wow
they tryna get involved
when all our shadows disappeared
putting overtime on your body
yeah you used to ride like a taxi
going out of my mind
where you go ill follow
aint no other
the shadow of my life
so now i ask
hey yeah ratatata
i walked away but you warned me then
whos pulling strings im just pointing out all the puppets
but hey now hey now you know girl know girl
some just tryin to get by
and then i tell her as i turn out the light
no matter how far
can you make it clap no hands for me

wont even stand the devils dance
fighting every second of the day for your dreams girl
dont need no usher
and im a sucker for the way that you move babe
and all my friends they tell me they see
im here right now right now
oh my darling you are wonderful tonight
spend it up so big
and i say oh
when you ask
got the aura of the mafia
you could be my destinys child on the scene girl
and you were bound to see
even wrote down the date that i fell for you
sipping on your lips hanging on by a thread baby
when theres a boss in me
but she aint the only one no
you know that i see it
we gon make you bounce and you say yeah
but i cant stand these nights alone
you left your diary at my house
but honestly
give it all oh
smile on your face
now we are on top of the world cause thats just how we do do it
but now i know a perfect way to let you go
i can see it in your eyes
but its all in my head
living like theres only me
left her baggage for rimowa
do you really love me baby
only then can i begin to live again
i dont know if this makes sense but youre my hallelujah
so i know we got issues baby true true true
so them other girls can go they dont make me feel so good
remember them times that we fall
she be acting bougie
if life is a movie
and how was i supposed to know i miss you so
but howd we get in this position
let me show you cause talk is cheap
everybodys tryna be a billionaire
ive got your photograph
cool i dropped out i dont really take test
so the whole world knows
and i cried at the curb
rollin up to party got the right vibe
so if you need perfect im not built for you one two three ooh
give my last hello hope its worth it
do the boogie like
i get my weed from california thats that shit
i wanna see you lose control
its green where you water it
its hard to feel you slipping you need to know

ice on my wrist im the nice guy
the way i breathe you in in
