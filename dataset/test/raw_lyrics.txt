The world on drugs
Ten (yeah) thousand dollar plates
Thousand dollar plates
Thousand dollar plates, fine china
Shorty like a, uh
Shorty like a
(Wheezy outta here)
Shorty like a thousand dollar plate, fine china
Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her
Then I jump in the pussy like a lake, I'm a diver
And her last man was a pussy, had a vagina
I get lost in her eyes, like dust from the skies
It's her body or nobody, I refuse to compromise
So if she leaves, I'ma kill her, oh, she'll die
Did I say that out loud? I'm so crazy about mine
Going insane, feel you picking up and moving things inside my brain
I know I don't have to argue about everything
But we don't have the same soul
Went and sold drugs 'til we got a bigger bankroll
Tell me that you love me, baby, say it again
Repeat it over and over until it's in my brain
Picked up the drugs so I let my brain go
Woulda fried yours too, but I'm selfish about my Percs, oh
Shorty like a thousand dollar plate, fine china
Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her
Then I jump in the pussy like a lake, I'm a diver
And her last man was a pussy, had a vagina
I get lost in her eyes, like dust from the skies
It's her body or nobody, I refuse to compromise
So if she leaves, I'ma kill her, oh, she'll die
Did I say that out loud? I'm so crazy about mine
I'm so crazy about mine (Wheezy outta here)
I'm going to Pluto with my girl (Oh, shorty)
I'm going to Jupiter with my girl (Don't call your exes)
I'm going to Mars with my girl (Don't call your exes)
I'm going to Saturn with my girl
Been feeling like I'm running out of space
You need to send your location, I can't think
I done fell in love twice but I gotta be lying
'Cause I'm living ten lives, I go crazy about mines (Ayy)
Shorty like a thousand dollar plate, fine china
Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her
Then I jump in the pussy like a lake, I'm a diver
And her last man was a pussy, had a vagina
I get lost in her eyes, like dust from the skies
It's her body or nobody, I refuse to compromise
So if she leaves, I'ma kill her, oh, she'll die
Did I say that out loud? I'm so crazy about mine
Did I say that out loud?
I'm so crazy about mine
When I look back
Tracing fingertips over plastic bags
Thinking, "I wish I could extrapolate some small intention
Or maybe get your attention for a minute or two"
Will I die? Or will I get to that ten-year mark?
Where I beat the extinction of telomeres?
And if I do, will you be there with me, Father, Sister, Brother?
Charlie, stop smoking
Caroline, will you be with me?
Will the baby be alright?
Will I have one of mine?
Can I handle it even if I do?
You said that I might
It's not fair or so they said
To carry a child
I guess I'll be fine
It wasn't my idea the cocktail of things that twist neurons inside
But without them, I'd die
They say there's irony in the music, it's a tragedy
I see nothing Greek in it
Give me a mausoleum in Rhode Island with Dad, Grandma, Grandpa and Dave
Who hung himself real high
In the National Park sky, it's a shame and I'm crying right now
To get to you, save you if I take my life
Find your astral body, put it into my eyes
Give you two seconds to cry
Take you home, I, I'll give you a blanket
Your spirit can sit and watch TV by my side
'Cause, baby, I ran through a time when I felt you were doing it
I couldn't handle it, I was in Monaco
I couldn't hear what they said on the telephone
I had to sing for the prince in two hours
Sat in the shower
Gave myself two seconds to cry
It's a shame that we die
When I was fifteen, naked, next-door neighbors did a drive-by
Pulled me up by my waist, long hair to the beach side
I wanted to go out like you, swim with the fishes
That he caught on Rhode Island beaches
But, sometimes, it's just not your time
Caroline
What kind of mother was she to say I'd end up in institutions?
All I wanted to do was kiss Aaron Greene and sit by the lake
Twisting lime into the drinks that they made
Have a babe at sixteen, the town I was born in and died
Aaron ended up dead and not me
What the fuck's wrong in your head to send me away never to come back
Exotic places and people to take the place of being your child?
I give myself two seconds to cry
Let it crash over me like the waves in the sea
Call me Aphrodite
As they bow down to me
Sunbather, moon chaser, queen of empathy
I give myself two seconds to breathe
And go back to being a serene queen
I just needed two seconds to be me
Don't you dare say
That you'll braid my hair, babe
If you don't really care
You wanted me sadder
You wanted me sadder
Fishtail what's the matter, like that
Skipping rope in the bayou, bayou
Slip softly into rain
Not that smart but I've got things to say
Palm trees in black and white
I like to watch them say
You're so funny, I wish I could skinny-dip inside your mind
Lately I've been thinkin' about how things used to be
Swingin' in a nightgown underneath the old oak tree
Almost Victorian with you, you can talk to me
But lately, I can't see
Baby (you wanted me sadder)
Can't you see it?
For me, you are the one
And if I'm not the one for you
Don't you see it?
I was on the stairs
Ella Fitzgerald in the air
Feelin' hella rare
Baby, if you care
Baby, don't you dare say
You'll braid my hair, babe
Don't you dare say
That you'll braid my hair, babe
If you don't really care
You wanted me sadder
Dancing there in the hot, hot sun
I know that we've got problems
I plan to address them another day
Palm trees in black and white
I see in technicolor
Maybe I'll take my glasses off
So I stop painting red flags green
Lately I've been sunning in the L.A. River bed
Wearing nothin' but the summer bruises on my knees
I like how you talk, how you speak, how you look at me
But lately, I can't see
Baby (you wanted me sadder)
(You wanted me sadder)
Can't you see it?
For me, you are the one
And if I'm not the one for you
Don't just say it
I was on the stairs
Ella Fitzgerald in the air
Feelin' hella rare
Baby, if you care
Baby, don't you dare say
You'll braid my hair, see
Baby, if you care, then (don't you dare say)
Baby, don't you dare say (that you'll braid my hair, babe)
That you really care
Don't you dare say
That you'll braid my hair
When you get home tonight
If you don't really care
Yeah, don't you dare say
That you'll braid my hair, babe
If don't really care, see
That you'll braid my hair
If you're not coming home to me
Mm-mm
You want someone sadder
Skipping rope in the bayou, bayou
Slip softly into rain
I'm not that smart
But I've got things to say
White lines, pretty baby, tattoos
Don't know what they mean, they're special, just for you
White lines, baking powder on the stove
Cooking up a dream, turning diamonds into snow
I feel you, pretty baby, feel me
Turn it up hot, loving you is free
I like it down, like it down, way low
But you already know that, you already know
Come on down to Florida, I got somethin' for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah
Guns in the summertime, chic-a-Cherry Cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me, if you'll be by my side
Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all the dope fiends
Yayo, yayo, yayo
Strung in my mouth and gold hoops
You like your little baby like you like your drinks, cool
White lines, pretty daddy, go skiing
You snort it like a champ, like the winter we're not in
Come on down to Florida, I got somethin' for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah
Guns in the summertime, chic-a-Cherry Cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me, if you'll be by my side
Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all the dope fiends
Yayo, yayo, yayo
We could get high in Miami, ooh-ooh
Dance the night away
People never die in Miami, ooh-ooh
That's what they all say
(You believe me, don't you baby?)
Come on down to Florida, I got somethin' for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah
Guns in the summertime, chic-a-Cherry Cola lime
Prison don't mean nothing to me, if you'll be by my side
Yayo, yayo, yayo
All the Floridians like
Yayo, yayo, yayo
All the Colombians like
Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all my girlfriends
Yayo, yayo, yayo
That's how we do it, like
Mm-mm, pretty baby
White lines, pretty baby
Gold teeth, pretty baby
Dance the night away

Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Thirty blocks to Fordham Road
That’s a bad neighborhood
Crack house on the corner
I know I shouldn’t do what it is I could
The stone Mary in the garden
She let me know she watching
And she said I better get walking
I better walk away
I don’t know why it is that I wanna stay
I don’t know what it is that
Makes me feel this way
But I’m not gonna do what I hear me say
I’m just gonna walk, I’m gonna walk away
I catch a dollar in the wind and I
Buy a cup of coffee
There’s a place on Valentine
That still charge ninety cent
I keep on walking in the daytime
And in my eyes, it’s always nighttime
And I like it when it’s me at night
‘Cause that’s when all the stars come out
Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh
I don't know why it is that I wanna stay
I don't know what it is that
Makes me feel this way
But I'm not gonna do what I hear me say, oh
I'm just gonna walk, I'm gonna walk away
It's the greatest, it's the greatest day
It's the greatest, it's the greatest day, oh
I'm not gonna do what I hear me say
I'm just gonna walk, I'm gonna walk away
Fuck you, motherfucker, you a hoe-ass nigga
I don't know why you tryna go big, nigga you ain't shit
Walking around like you God's gift to Earth, nigga you ain't shit
You ain't even buy me no outfit for the fourth
I need that Brazilian, wavy, twenty-eight inch, you playin'
I shouldn't be fuckin' with you anyway, I need a baller-ass, boss-ass nigga
You is a off-brand-ass nigga, everybody know it, your homies know it, everybody fuckin' know
Fuck you nigga, don't call me no more
You won't know, you gonna lose on a good bitch
My other nigga is on, you off
What the fuck is really going on?
This dick ain't free
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made end's meet, eatin' your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently all I seen was Spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes
Without a Mercedes Benz and twenty-four inch rims
Five percent tint, and air conditioning vents
Hell fuckin' naw, this dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pitbull
Bullshit, matador, matador
Had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious
Kept me up watchin' pornos in poverty
Apology? No
Watch you politic with people less fortunate, like my self
Every dog has it's day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter of fact, it need interest
Matter of fact, it's nine inches
Matter of fact, see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin', my consensus
Been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
Fuck you think is in more shit?
Porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
Choice is devastated, decapitated the horseman
Oh America, you bad bitch, I picked cotton that made you rich
Now my dick ain't free
I'ma get my Uncle Sam to fuck you up
You ain't no king
I like to see everything in neon
Drink lime green, stay up 'til dawn
Maybe the way that I'm living is killing me
I like to light up the stage with a song
Do shit to keep me turned on
But one day I woke up like
"Maybe I'll do it differently"
So I moved to California but it's just a state of mind
It turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie
Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
It's killing me slowly
Dream a little dream of me
Make me into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do
I used to shoot up my veins in neon
And shit's even brighter, you're gone
So many things I would say to you
I want you
You moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
And you know everyone adores you
You can't feel it and you're tired
Baby wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
But it's killing me slowly
Dream a little dream of me
Turn this into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do
It turns out California's more than just a state of mind
I met you on the boulevard, wind through my hair, you blew my mind
And if I wasn't so fucked up, I think I'd fuck you all the time
(I really do) It's killing me slowly
Fuck it, I love you (I moved to California, but it's just a state of mind)
Fuck it, I love you (It turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie)
Fuck it, I love you (Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine)
I really do (It's killing me slowly)
Fuck it, I love you (California dreamin', got my money on my mind)
Fuck it, I love you (Chances in my veins, running out of time)
Fuck it, I love you (California dreamin', got my money on my mind)
I really do (Chances in my veins, running out of time)
Fuck it, I love you (California dreamin', got my money on my mind)
Fuck it, I love you (Chances in my veins, running out of time)
Fuck it, I love you (California dreamin', got my money on my mind)
I really do (Chances in my veins, running out of time)
Life is awesome, I confess
What I do, I do best
You got nothing, I got tested
And I'm best, yes
Lay me down tonight
In my linen and curls
Lay me down tonight
Riviera girls
I fucked my way up to the top
This is my show
I fucked my way up to the top
Go, baby, go
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

Mimicking me is a fucking bore

Tell me something nice
About your favorite girl
I fucked my way up to the top

This is my show
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
This is my show
Need you, baby, like I breathe you, baby
I need you, baby, more, more, more, more
Need you, baby, like I breathe you, baby, ah, ah
Ahh, ahh
High, there's a reason for my high
There's a whole world outside
I saw it last night
Yeah, they're saying I'm insane
'Cause I wanna go to space
And leave it all behind
And leave it all behind
I'm leaving
I (I), I've never, ever been this far away from home
And now I know
It gets dark, yeah, it gets dark
And I, I'm moving at the speed of light, I had to go
But now I know
It gets dark so I can see the stars
Yeah, my feet came off the ground
Gravity won't hold me down
No, not this time
I'm not who I used to be
'Cause I came out here to see
The universe inside
I'm leaving them behind
I'm leaving them
I (I), I've never, ever been this far away from home
And now I know
It gets dark, yeah, it gets dark
And I, I'm moving at the speed of light, I had to go
But now I know
It gets dark so I can see the stars
It gets dark so I can see the stars
I am sleepin' with your best friend
How do you like me now?
How do you like me now?
I am sleepin' with your best friend
How do you like me now?
How do you like me now?
Come on, get drunk you know you wanna
I am, you can won't tell no one about it
It's gonna be a ball it's gonna be a ball
I am lyin', usin' again come on
It's gonna be a ball
Come on, get drunk you know you wanna
I am, you can won't tell no one about it
It's gonna be a ball it's gonna be a ball
Cigarettes, Robitussin
Will I ever get to heaven?
Cigarettes, and Robitussin
Will I ever get to heaven?
It's not looking good now, oh
It's not looking good now
Come on, get drunk you know you wanna
Come on get drunk, get drunk
Get drunk, get drunk get drunk, get drunk
Get drunk
Finally, I'm crossing the threshold
From the ordinary world to the reveal of my heart
Undoubtedly, that will for certain
Take the dead out of the sea and the darkness from the arts
This is my commitment, my modern manifesto
I'm doing it for all of us who never got the chance
For, and for (shut up, shut up)
And all my birds of paradise (shut up, shut up)
Who never got to fly at night (shut up, shut up)
'Cause they were caught up in the dance
Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I wanna get off, but I keep riding the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game, or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)
Finally
Gone is the burden of the Crowley way of being
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was I
Was not discerning
And you, as we found out
Were not in your right mind
There's no more chasing rainbows and hoping for an end to them
Their arches are illusions, solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them (touch, touch)
There's nothing to hold on to (hold, hold)
The colors used to lure you in (shut up, shut up)
And put you in a trance (ah, ah, ah, yeah)
Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I wanna get off, but I keep riding the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game, or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)
You got a face like the Madonna
Crying tears of gold
Been pumping gas
At the Texaco road to road
You're on the run
Oh baby yeah you're on the run
Oh baby
I'm not a trick boy, I'm a trick for you
You give me butterflies
Heart skipping one two
I know you're sick boy,
I wanna get the flu
I'm running temperatures
Thinking of your love, boo.
Brooklyn move my soul like this
Kissing my stilettos move
Your mouth up to my lips
Come on over ghetto baby
(He said show me what you got girl)
Come on over ghetto baby
(Drop it like it's hot girl)
I know your lips say
That you wanna but your heart's a no
But boy your hips say that your gonna when you hold me
Hold me
You're so fun
Baby you are so much fun
Baby
My local rock star, The really big crew
I'm feeling you boy, You're liking me too
I'm clocking chicks left and right
Just to get to you
You're out there on the grind now come home to your
Queen, boo.
Brooklyn move my soul like this
Kissing my stilettos
Move your mouth up to my lips

(He said show me what you got girl)
Come on over ghetto baby
(Drop it like it's hot girl)
We're a match mad in heaven
If they're gonna talk let 'em
If they don't think we're good together
Baby just forget 'em
When he's bad he's bad
But when he's good no one's better
Cos we're a match made in heaven
And this kind of love's forever
Brooklyn move my soul like this
Kissing my stilettos
Move your mouth up to my lips
Come on over ghetto baby
(He said show me what you got girl)
Come on over ghetto baby
(Drop it like it's hot girl)
Brooklyn move my soul like this
Kissing my stilettos
Move your mouth up to my lips
Come on over ghetto baby
(He said show me what you got girl)
Come on over ghetto baby
(Drop it like it's hot girl)
You know it's crazy, 'cause nights like this
Would start out with a little private party
You sneak me in your mom's house
I know I mighta spilled my drink, but
Really wasn't tryin' to spill my heart out
I mean it started as a conversation
I was really tryin' to get my thoughts out
But then we make moves and we make plans
Had the whole thing mapped out
See, you were gonna go to college
And to pay for bills I'd figure the job out
And you knew I had to say it, but them day's gone
Now I moved on and you switched phones
Hopefully reincarnation will bring us back to the place we belong
Summer after high school when we first met
We make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you
In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you
I put those records on
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the blues
Its time to face the music
I'm no longer your muse
In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
The o-o-o-o-o-one
The o-o-o-o-o-one
The o-o-o-o-o-one
The one that got away
I'm falling for you like dominoes
From the top of the hundredth floor
Look out below Geronimo
Tryin' to get behind the closed doors to your soul
Why'd you have to end the show
We had such a beautiful plot
There was still more story to go
Now look, I'm not insinuating that
You're some type of fair weather player
But even if the whole world falls over
I wouldn't be aware of a glacier
I just wanna see you wake up
Doing your hair in the mirror with your makeup
Then, maybe in the next lifetime we could make up
In another life
I would be your girl
We keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
The o-o-o-o-o-one
The o-o-o-o-o-one
The o-o-o-o-o-one
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away
Sometimes I wake up in the morning
To red, blue, and yellow skies
It's so crazy I could drink it like tequila sunrise
Put on that Hotel California
Dance around like I'm insane
I feel free when I see no one
And nobody knows my name
God knows I live
God knows I died
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed and cried
God knows I loved
God know I lied
God knows I lost
God gave me life
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
Sometimes I wake up in the morning
To red, blue and yellow lights
On Monday they destroyed me
But by Friday I'm revived
Put on that hotel California
Wear my blinders in the rain
I've got nothing much to live for
Ever since I found my fame
God knows I live
God knows I died
God knows I loved
God knows I lied
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed and cried
God knows I lost
God gave me life
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
So let there be light
Let there be light
Light up my life
Light up my life
Let there be light
Let there be light
Light up my life
Light up my life
God knows I tried
In the land of Gods and Monsters
I was an angel living in the garden of evil
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed
Shining like a fiery beacon
You got that medicine I need
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly
Me and God, we don't get along
So now I sing
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me"
"This is Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost
Innocence lost
In the land of Gods and Monsters
I was an angel looking to get fucked hard
Like a groupie incognito, posing as a real singer
Life imitates art
You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart, please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said, "Baby, that's alright with me"
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me"
"This is Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost
Innocence lost
When you talk, it's like a movie
And you're making me crazy
'Cause life imitates art
If I get a little prettier, can I be your baby?
You tell me, "Life isn't that hard"
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me"
"This is Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost
Innocence lost
Doomed from the start
We met with a goodbye kiss
I broke my wrist
It all kicked off I had no choice
You said that you didn't mind
'Cause love's hard to find
La-la-la-la
Maybe the days we had are gone
Living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see
No more laughs
No more photographs
Turning slowly
Looking back, see
No words can save this
You're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to
Be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope someday that we will meet again
Running wild
Giving it everyone
Now that's all done
Cause we burnt out, that's what you do
When you have everything
It can't be true
La-la-la-la
Maybe the days we had are gone
Living in silence for too long
Open you're eyes and what do you see
The last stand
Let go of my hand
Turning slowly
Looking back, see
No words can save this
You're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to
Be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope someday that we could meet again
You go your way
And I'll go my way
No words can save us
This lifestyle made us
Run along like i'm supposed to
Be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
You're in the bar, playing guitar
I'm trying not to let the crowd next to me
It's so hard sometimes with a star
When you have to share him with everybody
You're in the club, living it up
I'm trying not to let the crowd notice me
It's so sweet, swingin' to the beat
When I know that you're doing it all for me
And every time you look up
I know what you're thinking of
I know what you're thinking of
You want my
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
Time after time, writing my lines
Having my baby there next to me
It's so sweet, pouring you a drink
And pretending that nothing means anything
This is my life, you by my side
Key lime and perfume and festivals
Taking our dreams, turning them to things
It's like magic, babe, isn't life wonderful?
And every time we hook up
I know what you're thinking of
I know what you're thinking of
You want my
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
Front row, every show like a hype man (hmm)
Sing along word for word while she my bae (yeah)
Side stage, fans screamin' causin' migraines
Yamborghini-high, but she ain't on my grade (hmm, hmm)
God dang, got a nigga acting irate (hmm, hmm)
My babe, my babe, stay on my brain (yeah)
My babe, made me sing to a fire escape
City girl, but she grew up in the tri-state
She ain't got no time for no groupie love (hmm)
We don't pay no minds to the thug with a (hmm)
Love girls, you and I, so who do we trust?
You and I 'til the day we die
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
You are my babe
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
Big girl in the red dress
She's just trying to impress us
And she's got the barley fever
But she doesn't make a sound
She's just hanging around
She's just hanging around
Down the court road early
With the Hustlers big and burly
There's a million of 'em selling
And the buyers can be found
They're just hanging around
They're just hanging around
Christ he told his mother
Christ he told her not to bother
Cos he's alright in the city
Cos he's high above the ground
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
One of 'em comes over
Got a monkey on his shoulder
And the monkey's getting grinner
But his eyes are on the ground
He's just hanging around
He's just hanging around
I'm moving to a coleheme
With the leather all around me
And the sweat is getting steamy
But their eyes are on the ground
They're just hanging around
They're just hanging around
Christ he told his mother
Christ he told her not to bother
Cos he's alright in the city
Cos he's high above the ground
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
Christ he told his mother
Christ he told her not to bother
Cos he's alright in the city
Cos he's high above the ground
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
He's just hanging around
Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world, it's a skippidy doo da day
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A.
Good morning, mornin', hello sunshine
Wake up, sleepy head
Why'd you move that bojangle clock
So far away from the bed?
Just one more minute that's why we moved it
One more hug or two
Do you love wakin' up next to me
As much as I love wakin' up next to you?
You make the coffee, I'll make the bed
I'll fix your lunch, and you'll fix mine!
Now tell me the truth do these old shoes look funny?
Honey, it's almost nine
Now you be careful, got to go
"I love you, have a beautiful day!"
And kiss the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A.
Skippidy doo da thank you Lord for makin' him for me
And thank you for letting life turn out the way
That I always thought it could be
There once was a time, that I could not imagine
How it would feel to say
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A.
Now shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world, it's a skippidy doo da day
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A.
Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world, it's a skippidy doo da day
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A.
Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world, it's a skippidy doo da day
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A.
Do you want me or do you not?
I heard one thing, now I'm hearing another
Dropped a pin to my parking spot
The bar was hot, it's 2 am, it feels like summer
Happiness is a butterfly
Try to catch it like every night
It escapes from my hands into moonlight
Every day is a lullaby
I hum it on the phone like every night
And sing it for my babies on the tour life
Ah ah
If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That could happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt
I said, "Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat
Ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you
Baby, I just wanna dance (dance)
With you (dance)
Baby, I just wanna dance (dance)
With you
Left the canyon, drove to the club
I was one thing, now I'm being another
Go down to Sunset in the truck
I'll pick you up if you're in town on the corner
Ah ah
Happiness is a butterfly
We should catch it while dancing
I lose myself in the music, baby
Every day is a lullaby
Try to catch it like lightning
I sing it into my music, I'm crazy
If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That could happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt
I said, "don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat
Ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you
Baby, I just wanna dance (dance)
With you (dance)
Baby, I just wanna dance (dance)
With you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday Mr. President
Happy birthday to you
Thanks, Mr. President
For all the things you've done
The battles that you've won
The way you deal with U.S. Steel
And our problems by the ton
We thank you so much
Everybody, happy birthday
Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States!
Thank you!
I can now retire from politics after having had the birthday sang to me
In such a sweet way
I can't wait no more, no
Let's have a baby
What are we livin' for? Tell me
Let's make love, let's make love
So long have I gazed into your eyes
Wonderin' what they'd look like on a newborn child
I cannot lie when my hand is on your thighs
I'm thinking, isn't it a miracle that life comes from inside?
So long I have listened to your voice
Wonderin' what it would sound like coming from a girl or a boy
Isn't it funny that when you're truly in love
How just the thought of such things can bring you so much joy?
And I can't wait no more, oh no
Let's have a baby
Oh girl, come and shut the door, go on, shut it
Let's make love
you want to make love?
I'm leaving it up to you
I'll do what you want to do
But you got to understand
you're my woman and I'm your man
I can't even go for a ride
Believe me, honey, I've tried
Without thinking about a little baby
A baby sittin' right by my side
And if anybody in the whole wide world
Ever thought that they could do that for me
They are one mistaken girl
'cause baby, you got me, you got me open, yes you do
And we're doing just fine
If you really love me, baby
If you can find the time
I can't wait no more
Let's have a baby
Don't you want to?
What are we livin' for? Tell me, tell me
Let's have a baby
Come on, come on and shut the door, girl
you know what I want to do
Let's, let's make love
You can whistle for it
Baby, you'll never grow old in my eyes
With your golden grill, true love never dies
You wanna watch me while I watch TV
While you're t-t-t-t-touching me
We're forever young in paradise
As long as you got the Chevrolet, I will ride
We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in that Chevrolet from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Every man deserves to see the sunrise
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish you told me this
Where is mine?
You said I'd never make it
Out outta here alive
At the rate I was going, I'd be lucky to die
I was born so bad, not naturally right
The brightest star on Hollywood and Vine
We're gonna party like we're
Running outta time
We're getting drunk and driving
Fast on cherry wine
Never do belong to anyone I find
Leaving everything I ever knew behind
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish you told me this
Where is mine?
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish promised me this
Well, you lied
I learned how to make love from the movies
He found me waitressing at Ruby Tuesday's
He said I wanna buy you
A classic white milkshake
I said I'll serve you up
A special side of heartbreak
Special side of heartbreak
I was working down in the corner cafe
You drove by in a Chevrolet
Whistle at me as my hips go sway
Lana Del Rey, how you get that way?
How you get that way?
I said "He loves my heart shaped sunglasses
He loves the heart shape my ass is
Cristal, crystal champagne glasses"
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish you told me this
Where is mine?
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish promised me this
Well, you lied
She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black
Hey
Wait
I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey
Wait
I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey
Wait
I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice
Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath
Broken hymen of Your Highness, I'm left black
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back
Hey
Wait
I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey
Wait
I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey
Wait
I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice
She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black
Hey
Wait
I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey
Wait
I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey
Wait
I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice
Ah, tell me what the, ah, ah, ah
Oh, you got me sounding good too, ay (Will Will)
Okay, tell me what the deal is, you know I'm the illest
She from California, said she don't know where the 'Ville is
Shout out to the hometown, I know that they gon' feel this
When I hit the club, I walk in with a small village, and
Nothing's off limits
When you got the sauce, you know they running off with it
Now she actin' freaky, she was coming off timid at first
But I guess it really wasn't authentic, yes, sir
Now she got me, ooh, doin' somersaults in it
Know these fellas always talking but they weren't involved with it
I like me some women, not a bunch of sausages
I put in the work, I know that some of y'all didn't, yes, sir
And they come in all sizes, uh
We got new horizons
I guess I might as well dive in
No, it's not surprisin' the way you switched up
I used to kick it with the kids that rocked that Osiris
Used to rock a patch like a pirate
The garden still private
Drama got a Bentley, let me drive it
I'm a heavy hitter, Darryl Isaacs
And we rocking from side to side
Tell me now if you're trying to ride with me
You know I can find some time just to get
In tune with you, ay, ay, ay
Used to be the one that I idolized
Now I can't see you the same as I used to
I guess I need me a ride or die
Know you get sick of the games 'cause I do too
Late nights, head hurtin'
Open up the red curtains
You don't love me, you just networkin'
I'm still trying to be the best version of me
I got a whip plus room in the front seat
And it's so up-scene
She make me look like 2010 Kris Humphries
Y'all been getting too comfy
I been spending my time going off
Just in case you're wondering, never just one dream
Eighty proof all up in my bloodstream
Used to talk shit, now I wonder what they must think
Blame it on the crushed dreams that we used to all have
All I know is that we can't fall back now
And we rocking from side to side
Tell me now if you're trying to ride with me
You know I can find some time just to get
In tune with you, ay, ay, ay
Used to be the one that I idolized
Now I can't see you the same as I used to
I guess I need me a ride or die
Know you get sick of the games 'cause I do too
Do too, uh
Know you get sick of the games 'cause I do too
Do too, do too
I know you get, sicker, games, too
Know you get, know you get, know you get
Know you get sick of the games 'cause I do too
I don't know just where I'm going
But I'm gonna try for the kingdom, if I can
'Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man
When I put a spike into my vein
And I'll tell ya, things aren't quite the same
When I'm rushing on my run
And I feel just like Jesus' son
And I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know
I have made the big decision
I'm gonna try to nullify my life
'Cause when the blood begins to flow
When it shoots up the dropper's neck
When I'm closing in on death
And you can't help me, not you guys
Or all you sweet girls with all your sweet talk
You can all go take a walk
And I guess I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know
I wish that I was born a thousand years ago
I wish that I'd sail the darkened seas
On a great big clipper ship
Going from this land here to that
On a sailor's suit and cap
Away from the big city
Where a man cannot be free
Of all of the evils of this town
And of himself, and those around
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know
Heroin, be the death of me
Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life
Because a mainline to my vein
Leads to a center in my head
And then I'm better off than dead
Because when the smack begins to flow
I really don't care anymore
About all the Jim-Jim's in this town
And all the politicians makin' crazy sounds
And everybody puttin' everybody else down
And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds
'Cause when the smack begins to flow
Then I really don't care anymore
Ah, when the heroin is in my blood
And that blood is in my head
Then thank God that I'm good as dead
Then thank your God that I'm not aware
And thank God that I just don't care
And I guess I just don't know
Guess I got what I deserved
Kept you waiting there too long, my love
All that time, without a word
Did you really think that I'd forget
And regret
The special love I have for you
My baby blue
All those days became so long
Did you really think I'd do you wrong?
Dixie, when I let you go
Thought you'd realize I would know
I would show
The special love I have for you
My baby blue
What can I do? What can I say?
Except I want you by my side
How can I show you? Show me the way
Don't you know the times I've tried?
Guess that's all I have to say
Except the feeling just grows stronger everyday
Just one thing before I go
Take good care, baby, let me know
Let it grow
The special love you have for me
My Dixie dear
Boy, look at you looking at me
I know you know how I feel
Lovin' you is hard, bein' here's harder
You take the wheel
I don't wanna do this anymore
It's so surreal, I can't survive
If this is all that's real
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by, baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me
'Cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high baby, baby, bye bye
Boy, look at you lookin' at me
I know you don't understand
You could be a bad motherfucker
But that don't make you a man
Now you're just another one of my problems
Because you got out of hand
We won't survive
We're sinkin' into the sand
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by, baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me
'Cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high baby, baby, bye bye
Lights, camera, acción
I'll do it on my own
Don't need your money, money
To get me what I want
Lights, camera, acción
I'll do it on my own
Don't need your money, money
To get me what I want
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by, baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me
'Cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high baby, baby, bye bye
They never saw us coming

More, more
Na na na na na na na
All dressed up for a hit and run
Na na na na na na na
All dressed up for a hit and run
I was brought up as a southern belle
I grew into the queen of hell
You were just a little stowaway
That stabbed her way to save herself
You always liked the taste of blood
And I get off when I point the gun
It's so good to have someone to be so bad with
First one up was a preachers son
Last one down was an Englishman
I'm in bed with his bow tie on
All dressed up for a hit and run

So he thinks it's fun and games
He don't know our faces but
He'll never forget our names

You had one last pint before the cops broke in
You poured the gasoline and
I drove into the flames
History will hate us
But they'll never forget our names
They never saw us coming
Til they hit the floor
They just kept beggin for
More, more

Out of focus
Didn't take a second to notice
Now we're separated by oceans, vast
Couldn't make this last
I wish I'd have stayed
'Cause love can find a way to make your feet run heavy
Make your heart run steady
Then it breaks
So I'm praying that you're feeling the same
You know I spent some time in Hollywood tryna find
Something to get the thought of you and I off my mind
So tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from falling apart
Do you ever feel like going back to the start?
All the streetlights
Illuminate what home used to feel like
And when I get to thinking, can't sleep at night
No, I don't feel right
I wish I'd have stayed
'Cause love can find a way to make your feet run heavy
Make your heart run steady
Then it breaks
So I'm praying that you're feeling the same
You know I spent some time in Hollywood tryna find
Something to get the thought of you and I off my mind
So tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from falling apart
Do you ever feel like going back to the start?
Oh, and you know I would if I could
Maybe I spend more time in Hollywood than I should
So tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from falling apart
Do you ever feel like going back to the start?
If you can hear me, does it really have to end?
I feel you close, although you're eight hours ahead
If we can pick it up, then just tell me where and when
We'll go back to the start again
If you can hear me, does it really have to end?
I feel you close, although you're eight hours ahead
If we can pick it up, just tell me where and when
We'll go back to the start again
You know I spent some time in Hollywood tryna find
Something to get the thought of you and I off my mind
So tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from falling apart
Do now you ever feel like going back?
You know I spent some time in Hollywood tryna find
Something to get the thought of you and I off my mind
So tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from falling apart
Do you ever feel like going back to the start?
Oh, and you know I would if I could
Maybe I spend more time in Hollywood than I should
So tell me honey, oh, when you're just a step away from falling apart
Do you ever feel like going back to the start?
We both know that it's not fashionable to love me
But you don't go 'cause truly there's nobody for you but me
We could cruise to the blues
Wilshire Boulevard if we choose
Or whatever you want to do
We make the rules
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Say you want me too
Say you want me too
Dark blue
Dark blue
We both know the history of violence that surrounds you
But I'm not scared, there's nothing to lose now that I've found you
And we could cruise to the news
Pico Boulevard in your used
Little bullet car if we choose
Mr. born to lose
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Say you want me too
Say you want me too
Dark blue
Dark blue
There are violets in your eyes
There are guns that blaze around you
There are roses in between my thighs
And a fire that surrounds you
It's no wonder every man in town
Had neither fought nor found you
Everything you do is elusive
To even your honey dew
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Dreaming away your life
John met me down on the boulevard
Cried on his shoulder 'cause life is hard
The waves came in over my head
What you been up to, my baby?
Haven't seen you 'round here lately
All of the guys tell me lies, but you don't
You just crack another beer
And pretend that you're still here
This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear
Joe met me down at the training yard
Cuts on his face 'cause he fought too hard
I know he's in over his head
But I love that man like nobody can
He moves mountains and pounds them to ground again
I watched the guys getting high as they fight
For the things that they hold dear
To forget the things they fear
This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear
Now it's been years since I left New York
I've got a kid and two cats in the yard
The California sun and the movie stars
I watch the skies getting light as I write, as I
Think about those years
As I whisper in your ear
I'm always going to be right here
No one's going anywhere
I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms
If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly (woo)
See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me
If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it
I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly (woo!)
Hey, 'cause I believe in you
Oh
If I can see it (woo!), then I can do it (I can do it)
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it (hey)
I believe I can fly (woo!)
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly (I can fly)
I believe I can fly (I can fly)
I believe I can fly (I can fly)
If I just spread my wings (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)
If I just spread my wings (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly, I can fly)
Woo (I can fly)
Hm-mm... fly, fly, fly
Everything you do, everything I like
On the radio, dancin' in the night
Flowers in my hair, roses on the vine
You can be my guy, and I'm your baby, right?
My, my, apple of my eye
Looking really hot while I make ya cherry pie
Show me what you got, got a sparkle in your eye
You're so high
I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy
Every way I move, every way you like
Pulling on my dress, holdin' me too tight
I know we'll probably lose, only got tonight
But I love the way we kiss, love the way we fight
My, my, lookin' really fly
Like the way the bling on your pinkie ring shine
You spin me really fast and you catch me in the sky
I'm so high
I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy
I wish I may, I wish I might
Have my one true love tonight
Will you be mine?
Oh hi, lookin' kinda shy
Cause the way you put your hands on me
Well I, I can barely breathe
Baby boy you make me sigh-igh-igh-igh
I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy
Thunder in the air, trouble on my mind
Hold me in the dark, kiss it all behind
Baby don't be scared, come on honey, smile
Everything is fine now, everything is fine
My, my, talkin' all night
Laughin' really hard and it makes me wanna cry
I love our playing house, love our dressin'-up nights
Drinks on ice
I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you, I want you
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
I caught you, I caught you
I caught you boy, I caught you boy
So here we are
Like we were
To feed apart
In different worlds
No need to say
Another word
No, I should leave
But I don't wanna go just yet
'Cause I'm not really over it
You remind my heart
Of a lie I wish you never told
But it's all I've got
Just five more minutes and I'm gone
Same old song like an echo, ooh
'Cause I know I'm better off alone
It is my pride and I really know I shouldn't stay but I don't wanna go
Now that I know the way it ends
The words we chose, irrelevant
Let's just pretend a little bit
I know I should leave but
I don't wanna go just yet
'Cause I'm not really over it
You remind my heart (you remind my heart)
Of a lie I wish you never told
But it's all I've got (all I've got)
Just five more minutes and I'll go
(Five more minutes and I'll go)
Same old song like an echo, ooh
'Cause I know I'm better off alone (better off alone)
It is my pride and I really know I shouldn't stay but I don't wanna go
(Ooh, ooh)
Just five more minutes and I'll go
(Five more minutes and I'll go)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Shouldn't stay but I don't wanna go
Same old song like an echo (ooh, ooh, ooh)
(I'm better off alone)
It is my pride and I really know I shouldn't stay but I don't wanna go

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts, oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, (oh-oh)
The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em, oh
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
Put your red boots on
Baby, giddy up
Baby wants a dance
Baby gets her way
Dreamy nights
Talk to me with that whiskey breath
Twirl me twice
I'll treat you like a holiday
And don't say you're over me
When we both know that you ain't
Don't say you're over me
Baby, it's already too late
Just do what you do best with me
Dance me all around the room
Spin me like a ballerina, super high
Dance me all around the moon
Light me up like the 4th of July
Once, twice, three times
The guy I ever thought I would meet, so
Don't say you're over me
When we both know that you lie
If you lie down right next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
If you lie down right next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
When you lie down right next to me
Get your jacket on
Be a gentleman
Get into your truck
And pick me up at eight
'Cause we were built for
The long haul freight train
Burnt by fire
Without trial like a stowaway
And don't say you're over me
When they all know that you ain't
If you lay down right next to me
Dance me all around the room
Spin me like ballerina super high
Dance me all around the moon
Like six times 'til I'm sick and I cry
Once, twice, three times
The guy I ever thought I would meet, so
Don't say you're over me
When they all know that you're lying
If you lie down right next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, you lie
If you lie down right next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, you lie
When you lie down right next to me
